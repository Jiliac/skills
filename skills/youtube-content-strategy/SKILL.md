# YouTube Content Strategy

Framework for YouTube content creation extracted from Amixem (Maxime), a top French YouTuber (~10M subscribers, ~2B+ cumulative views), from his GDYI podcast interview. Applies to creators at any scale.

## Concept Validation Pipeline

Validate the packaging BEFORE building the product:

1. **Title + Thumbnail first** -- refuse to greenlight production without a validated title+thumbnail combo. Inspired by MrBeast who presents concepts as thumbnails to his team before anything is produced. Parallels Amazon's "Two-Pager" (write the press release first) and DJI's "trailer first" (ship the announcement, then figure out production).
2. **3-week hype decay test** -- write 10 concepts, wait 3 weeks. Only 4-5 survive your own enthusiasm filter. If you still feel excited after 3 weeks, the concept has legs.
3. **6-month planning horizon** -- first 2-3 months locked, rest flexible. Feed concepts to production team progressively; delay committing to ones you are unsure about.
4. **Solo creative retreats** -- 2-day retreats (sea, isolated location), all notifications off. Watch series, consume content for inspiration. Notes accumulate over 3-4 months, then crystallize during the retreat.

## Algorithm Mechanics

Key principles for how YouTube distributes content:

- **Subscribers are a vanity metric** -- subscriber count is increasingly decorrelated from views. Sponsors still look at it first, so ask viewers to subscribe (show the "90% of you watch without subscribing" stat -- it works).
- **Bad launch != bad video** -- Amixem's worst-launching video became his most-viewed ever. The algorithm can push a video over 1-3 years. Do not panic on day one.
- **Irregular posting is now forgiven** -- YouTube no longer punishes breaks (unlike Twitch, which is brutal on absence). Regularity matters more for learning speed than for algorithmic favor.
- **5-10K views threshold** -- the algorithm needs enough initial data to classify and push a video. Below this, it cannot make informed decisions.
- **Timing matters less than it used to** -- Amixem publishes Sundays at 17:25, but a 3 AM publish can work if the algorithm decides to push it.
- **TV is now #1 device** -- connected TVs, consoles (PS5, Xbox), Apple TV, Freebox are the primary viewing device for horizontal content. YouTube competes with Netflix, not Instagram.

## Format Strategy: Horizontal vs Vertical

Choose your lane -- these are separate audiences:

- **Horizontal (long-form)** and **vertical (Shorts)** subscribers do not cross over. Tibo InShape is #1 French YouTuber by subs (via Shorts) but horizontal views do not follow proportionally.
- **Vertical = built-in second channel** without the management overhead. Use Shorts for behind-the-scenes, lighter concepts that do not warrant a full video.
- **Long-form docs (1h) earn MORE** than short viral hits (15min) even with fewer views, due to more mid-roll ad breaks and higher completion-based revenue.
- **Second channels are a second front** -- only open one if the content truly does not fit the main channel. It is a fully independent entity with its own algorithmic score.

## Creative Craft

- **Pixar "double-reading"** as north star -- jokes for adults AND kids in the same content. A video about "1000 layers of cardboard" has teen DIY appeal AND adult humor layered in.
- **Create playgrounds for improvisation** -- design the format/rules (the game), then improvise the comedy within that frame. Every episode of a recurring series is a fresh creative challenge: same rules, different game.
- **Entertainment-to-documentary evolution arc** -- gaming -> humor -> variety shows -> documentaries. The entertainment funnel brings the audience; the docs plant seeds of curiosity (submarines, container ships, polar stations).

## Posting and Distribution

- **Cross-platform posting is nearly useless for YouTube traffic** -- Amixem tracked with Bitly for 6 months: Twitter, Insta, Facebook drove <1% of YouTube views. The algorithm handles distribution.
- **Exception**: cross-post selectively for major projects. Multi-device households changed the dynamic (someone sees it on Insta, launches YouTube on their TV).
- **"Ask people to subscribe" works** -- show the unsubscribed viewer percentage. Every major YouTuber does this because it moves the needle.

## Monetization

- **Pre-rolls** (before), **mid-rolls** (during), **post-rolls** (after) -- longer videos = more ad breaks = more revenue per view.
- **Sponsor integrations** are dedicated segments (look at camera, explain the sponsor). Not hidden product placement. Sign annual contracts (4-6 months of runway) for financial stability.
- **You can cut sections from published videos** (but not add). This saves videos from legal issues without killing reach.

## Production and Business

- **Internalize your team** -- Amixem runs 30 CDI employees (full-time), no freelancers on set. Province locations (Angers) cut costs drastically vs Paris.
- **Build your own infrastructure** -- owning studios removes dependency on rental availability and external constraints. Monthly mortgage in province = half-day rental in Paris.
- **Protect creative freedom** -- no external interference on concepts. Sponsors who try to dictate creative decisions get dropped. "Our concepts, take it or leave it."
- **MrBeast's openness vs concept originality** -- MrBeast shares everything (showed upcoming concepts + AdSense to 50 YouTubers). Amixem prefers to protect concept originality to differentiate.
