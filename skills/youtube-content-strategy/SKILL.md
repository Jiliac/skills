# YouTube Content Strategy

Framework for YouTube content creation extracted from Amixem (Maxime), a top French YouTuber (~10M subscribers, ~2B+ cumulative views), from his GDYI podcast interview. Applies to creators at any scale.

## Concept Validation Pipeline

Validate the packaging BEFORE building the product:

1. **Title + Thumbnail first** -- refuse to greenlight production without a validated title+thumbnail combo. Inspired by MrBeast who, as Amixem described it, presents concepts as thumbnails to his team before anything is produced. Parallels Amazon's "Two-Pager" (write the press release first) and DJI's "trailer first" (ship the announcement, then figure out production).
2. **3-week hype decay test** -- write 10 concepts, wait 3 weeks. Only 4-5 survive your own enthusiasm filter. If you still feel excited after 3 weeks, the concept has legs.
3. **6-month planning horizon** -- first 2-3 months locked, rest flexible. Feed concepts to production team progressively; delay committing to ones you are unsure about.
4. **Solo creative retreats** -- 2-day retreats (sea, isolated location), all notifications off. Watch series, consume content for inspiration. Notes accumulate over 3-4 months, then crystallize during the retreat.

## Algorithm Mechanics

Key principles for how YouTube distributes content, based on Amixem's observations:

- **Bad launch != bad video** -- Amixem's worst-launching video became his most-viewed ever. The algorithm can push a video over 1-3 years. Do not panic on day one.
- **Irregular posting is now forgiven** -- YouTube no longer punishes breaks. Regularity matters more for learning speed than for algorithmic favor.
- **5-10K views threshold** (Amixem's observation, not confirmed YouTube engineering) -- the algorithm appears to need enough initial data to classify and push a video. Below this range, it may not have enough signal to make informed recommendations.
- **Timing matters less than it used to** -- Amixem publishes Sundays at 17:25, but a 3 AM publish can work if the algorithm decides to push it.
- **"Ask people to subscribe" works** -- showing the unsubscribed viewer percentage moves the needle. Note: the specific "90% of you watch without subscribing" stat is channel-specific (Amixem's number), not a universal figure. Every major YouTuber uses this technique because it works as a free gesture of support that also unlocks commercial opportunities.

## Format Strategy

Choose your format based on the creative goal:

- **Vertical (Shorts) = built-in second channel** without the management overhead. Use Shorts for behind-the-scenes, lighter concepts that do not warrant a full video.
- **Long-form content (45min-1h) earns MORE** than short viral hits (15min) even with fewer views, due to more mid-roll ad breaks and deeper storytelling that sustains watch time. This is a content planning decision: invest in longer, richer narratives when the concept supports it.
- **Second channels are a second front** -- only open one if the content truly does not fit the main channel. It is a fully independent entity with its own algorithmic score.

## Creative Craft

- **Pixar "double-reading"** as north star -- jokes for adults AND kids in the same content. A video about "1000 layers of cardboard" has teen DIY appeal AND adult humor layered in.
- **Create playgrounds for improvisation** -- design the format/rules (the game), then improvise the comedy within that frame. Every episode of a recurring series is a fresh creative challenge: same rules, different game.
- **Entertainment-to-documentary evolution arc** -- gaming -> humor -> variety shows -> documentaries. The entertainment funnel brings the audience; the docs plant seeds of curiosity (submarines, container ships, polar stations).
- **Concept originality as differentiator** -- as Amixem described it, MrBeast shares everything openly (showed upcoming concepts + AdSense to 50 YouTubers), betting on execution scale. Amixem prefers to protect concept originality to differentiate. Neither is wrong -- it depends on whether your advantage is execution scale or creative differentiation.
