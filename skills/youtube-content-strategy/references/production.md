# Production and Business

Team structure, infrastructure decisions, and lessons from MrBeast's operation.

## Team Structure

Amixem's production company (Angers, France):

- **30 full-time CDI employees** (permanent contracts, not freelancers)
- **On set**: 5-10 people depending on the video
- **Post-production**: ~10 people
- **No external freelancers on set** -- everything internalized for consistency and availability
- **In-house agency (Sputnik)**: manages Amixem's commercial partnerships and represents other creators
- **Dedicated minia maker**: one person who only creates thumbnails

### Why Internalize Everything

- Province location (Angers) means fewer available freelancers with YouTube/internet experience
- CDI employees are always available, know the culture, and grow with the channel
- Trade-off: high fixed costs, but creative consistency and team cohesion
- Recruited talent often relocates to Angers -- the promise of normal working hours and work-life balance is a recruitment advantage

### Scaling Stages (Rule of 3)

Difficulty thresholds at every 3x:

- **1-3 people**: simple, direct communication
- **~10 people**: need basic management, start losing personal time to HR issues
- **~30 people**: need managers of managers, political dynamics emerge, but you can refocus on your core value (creating content)
- **100+ people**: enterprise-level complexity (Amixem peaked here, scaled back)

## Infrastructure Philosophy

**Own your means of production**:

- Amixem owns his studios, equipment, sets, and is building a new custom facility (~2-3M EUR for 850-900m2 of shooting floor + 1500m2 of offices)
- Monthly mortgage in Angers = half-day studio rental in Paris
- Custom-built facilities eliminate the "pushing walls" problem (sets that do not fit, forced production pauses for equipment moves between spaces)
- Triggered by visiting MrBeast's Greenville, NC facility: "seeing a purpose-built space made me realize I should stop adapting to my space and build one that adapts to me"

### New Facility Requirements

- 6.5m usable ceiling height (10-12m total building height to accommodate rails, lights, insulation)
- Dedicated set construction workshop (currently building sets in the same space they film -- impossible to do both simultaneously)
- Large green room for guests and extras (when 50 people fly in from around the world, they need proper hosting)
- VIP lounge for high-profile guests (Pierre Niney, Kev Adams, etc.)
- Single large transformable hangar rather than multiple fixed studios

## Work-Life Balance as Strategy

- Amixem insists on normal working hours for his team -- rejects the audiovisual industry norm of endless overtime
- "I do not want people dying at the task" -- and this is also a **recruitment argument**
- Travel shoots capped at 5 days maximum (1 day travel, 1 day setup/teardown, 2-3 days of actual shooting)
- Work-life balance is not a perk, it is a durability strategy for a 10+ year operation

## Lessons from MrBeast's Operation

### What Amixem Observed at Greenville

- **Immense production scale**: hundreds of cameras, business class flights for 50 YouTubers, purpose-built hangars
- **Everything pre-validated**: concepts presented as thumbnails + titles BEFORE any production begins. If the thumbnail/title combo does not pass internal validation, the video does not get made -- even if the concept is excellent.
- **Total transparency**: MrBeast showed 50 YouTubers his full upcoming concept slate, thumbnails, titles, and even his AdSense dashboard. He has "no sensitive information in his head."
- **He IS the brand**: "I am MrBeast. Tomorrow, yesterday, today, now, and 300 meters from here, I am MrBeast." No separation between person and brand.
- **Genuine humanitarian commitment**: behind the spectacle, serious teams of humanitarian professionals execute real programs. Not just big checks.

### What Amixem Took Away

- Build purpose-built infrastructure (the new facility)
- Thumbnail-first validation pipeline
- Confidence that the creator economy has durability ("if MrBeast is investing this much, this is not ending")

### What Amixem Would NOT Copy

- Total transparency about upcoming concepts (values originality)
- Sacrificing personal identity to become the brand 24/7
- The grueling pace (MrBeast spends almost no days at home per year)

## Guest Strategy

Evolution from self-contained to guest-driven content:

- Originally built the channel to be 100% independent of external guests (own crew, own comedians as cast members)
- Recently shifted to inviting external guests: Kev Adams, Paul Mirabel, Bigflo, Alban Ivanov, Pierre Niney
- Guests come to Angers (significant time investment for them) -- a sign of the channel's growing prestige
- Guest-driven videos access wider audiences (mainstream appeal) while core crew videos serve the loyal community
- Promo cycles help (actors/comedians promoting films/shows are more available), but the best guests come through genuine relationships
