# Format Strategy

Detailed guidance on horizontal vs vertical content, second channels, and audience dynamics.

## Horizontal vs Vertical: Two Separate Worlds

The audiences are almost completely disjoint:

- **Subscribers gained via Shorts will not watch long-form**, and vice versa.
- **Tibo InShape case study**: #1 French YouTuber by subscriber count, gained primarily through Shorts. His horizontal (long-form) view counts do not scale proportionally with his subscriber base. Proof that Shorts subs != long-form audience.
- **Biggest subscriber gainers globally are vertical-first creators**. The conversion to horizontal is not automatic and requires deliberate effort.

## When to Use Vertical (Shorts)

- Behind-the-scenes content (set construction, crew moments)
- Concepts that are inherently short: a single experience, a quick gag, a reaction
- Test: "Would this have been a full video 5 years ago?" If no, it is a Short now
- Amixem example: scooter sous-marin (underwater scooter ride in the Caribbeans) -- fun 60-second experience, not worth a 15-minute video

## Vertical as Built-in Second Channel

Before Shorts, creators debated opening a second channel for lighter content. Shorts solved this:

- No separate channel to manage, no split algorithmic score
- Shorts no longer trigger push notifications to all subscribers (fixed by YouTube)
- Acts as a "second channel without the second front"
- Saves the overhead of managing two channels, two upload schedules, two communities

## Second Channels: When They Make Sense

Open a second channel ONLY when:

- The content is a genuine niche passion that would alienate the main audience (e.g., ULM flying, RC cars)
- The format is fundamentally incompatible with the main channel identity
- You have the bandwidth to treat it as a fully independent entity

Do NOT open a second channel for:

- Behind-the-scenes (use Shorts instead)
- Overflow content
- "Just because other creators have one"

## Long-Form Economics

Long-form content (45min-1h+) earns more per video than short viral hits (15min), even with fewer views:

- More mid-roll ad break slots
- Higher taux de completion (completion rate) drives revenue
- Documentaries at 1h can outperform entertainment clips at 15min financially
- YouTube rewards watch time, not just clicks

## Acquisition vs Retention Trade-off

Amixem's format creates high barriers to entry for new viewers:

- ~7 minutes of intro before the concept starts (crew banter, private jokes, sponsor segment)
- Works because existing audience has built trust and enjoys the ritual
- Terrible for acquisition: a new viewer who lands cold will bounce
- Amixem acknowledges this trade-off and accepts it -- retention of core audience > new viewer acquisition
- Solution for acquisition: viral-friendly concepts ("50 Sosies") that are inherently accessible attract new viewers who then discover the deeper catalog
