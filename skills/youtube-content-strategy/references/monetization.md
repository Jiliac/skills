# Monetization Mechanics

Revenue sources, sponsor strategy, and financial planning for YouTube creators.

## YouTube Ad Revenue

Three types of programmatic ads:

- **Pre-rolls**: before the video starts
- **Mid-rolls**: during the video (creator places break points)
- **Post-rolls**: after the video ends

Key insight: **longer videos = more mid-roll slots = more revenue per view**. A 1-hour documentary with fewer views can outperform a 15-minute viral hit financially.

Revenue is driven by:

- Video length (more ad slots)
- Completion rate (viewers who stay generate more impressions)
- Audience geography (CPM varies by country)
- Content category (finance/tech CPMs > entertainment CPMs)

## Sponsor Integrations

Amixem's model for brand partnerships:

- **Dedicated segment**: look at camera, explain the sponsor transparently. Not hidden product placement.
- **Annual contracts**: sign 4-6 sponsors at the start of the year with multiple videos pre-purchased. This provides 4-6 months of guaranteed runway.
- **Creative independence**: the sponsor buys a slot in the video, not creative control. If a brand tries to dictate the concept or execution, drop them. "Our concepts, who loves us follows us."
- **Evolution**: early on, brand campaigns inspired concepts (positive). But then brands wanted creative control over the concept they "inspired" (negative). Amixem separated the two: concepts are 100% internal, sponsors buy placement.

## Financial Stability Framework

Lessons from Amixem's entrepreneurial parents (who nearly lost everything in 2008):

- **War chest**: maintain enough treasury to survive a downturn. During COVID, half of sponsors cancelled overnight. Having pre-signed annual contracts saved the business.
- **Diversified revenue**: YouTube ads + sponsors + side businesses (Spacefox merch, Akrone watches, Star Smash burgers). Never depend on a single income stream.
- **Province cost advantage**: Angers monthly studio mortgage = half-day rental in Paris. This margin compounds into financial resilience.

## Subscriber Count as Sponsor Currency

- Subscriber count is increasingly decorrelated from actual views
- Amixem's views stayed flat for 5 years while subscribers grew from ~6M to ~10M
- However, subscribers remain the **first metric sponsors and agencies look at**
- Therefore: ask viewers to subscribe. Show the "90% of you watch without subscribing" stat. It is a free gesture of support that unlocks commercial opportunities.

## YouTube Direct Payments

YouTube does not pay creators directly beyond ad revenue, with rare exceptions:

- YouTube Premium promotions (paid OP to promote the subscription)
- Dubbing contracts (Amixem voiced MrBeast's French channel for the "7 days on a desert island" video)
- No direct creator fund or bonus system from YouTube itself
- YouTube's value is in the platform, analytics, and human support (dedicated partner managers for large creators)

## Post-Publish Editing

- Creators can **cut sections** from already-published videos (but cannot add new content)
- This saves videos from legal issues (e.g., someone requests removal of their appearance) without deleting the entire video
- Minor impact: a few comments noting a "weird jump cut," but reach and algorithmic performance are preserved
- Critical safety valve for high-production videos with many participants (50+ people in "50 Sosies")
