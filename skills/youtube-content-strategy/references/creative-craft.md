Principles for concept development, creative evolution, and content philosophy.

## Pixar "Double-Reading" Principle

Amixem's north star for content creation:

- Every Pixar film has jokes for adults AND kids in the same scene
- Apply to YouTube: "1000 Layers of Cardboard" has teen DIY appeal (building a fort, escaping a challenge) AND adult humor (witty commentary, cultural references)
- Goal: a 15-year-old and a 40-year-old both enjoy the same video for different reasons
- This extends audience lifespan -- your viewers age with you, but new young viewers still enter

## Playgrounds for Improvisation

Amixem does not write scripted comedy. He designs **game frameworks**:

- "50 Sosies" (50 Lookalikes): the rules are set (people arrive, you rate them), but the comedy is improvised reactions
- "Piece Secrete" (Secret Room): the rules are set (find hidden passages between rooms), but the banter and discovery moments are live
- "Amnesia": the rules are set (wake up in a scenario with actors, deduce who you are), but the player's reactions are genuine
- Contrast with first-generation YouTubers (Cyprien, Norman) who wrote and performed scripted sketches
- This model scales: same series, infinite episodes, each one a fresh creative challenge

## The Entertainment Funnel

Amixem's content evolution over 13 years:

1. **Gaming** (early years) -- face-cam, Let's Plays, low production
2. **Humor/Parodies** -- tutos, song parodies, opportunistic content
3. **Variety shows** -- game shows with crew, guest-driven concepts, high production
4. **Documentaries** -- submarines, container ships, Tara Ocean polar station, marine science

The entertainment content (high reach, accessible) serves as a funnel into the documentary content (lower reach, higher impact). A viewer enters via "50 Sosies" and discovers a 1-hour doc on life aboard a nuclear submarine.

This is deliberate: "If I planted seeds of curiosity through my entertainment channel that changed someone's career trajectory, that is the best outcome."

## Concept Originality vs Sharing

Two philosophies observed:

**MrBeast approach**: Share everything openly. He showed 50 YouTubers his entire upcoming concept slate with thumbnails and even his AdSense revenue. His logic: execution matters more than the idea, and openness builds goodwill.

**Amixem approach**: Protect concept originality. He has experienced frustration when a concept he was developing was independently released by another creator. He values being the channel that "brings something different." He would not share his concept pipeline with peers.

Neither is wrong -- it depends on your competitive advantage (execution scale vs creative differentiation).

## Inspiration Sources

How Amixem generates concepts:

- **Series consumption**: watching TV shows triggers lateral thinking (Severance episode 9 inspired the "Amnesia" concept)
- **Real-world curiosity**: submarines, container ships, polar science stations -- anything that involves humans in confined, fascinating environments
- **Walking/idle time**: "you see a lamppost and think 'what if...'"
- **3-4 month accumulation**: notes pile up in a single note file, then crystallize during 2-day solo retreats
- **NOT on-demand**: creativity is not a tap. The retreat is for shaping ideas that already exist, not generating from scratch.
