## Phase 1: Foundation and Safety

### Session 1: Orientation and Self-Mapping (45 min)

**Warm-up:** Guided body scan. Rate tension 1-10 in: head, jaw, shoulders, chest, stomach, hands. Note which areas have sensation and which feel numb.

**Deep work:**

1. **Life domains inventory.** Rate each domain on two scales (1-10): How important is it? How consistently am I living it?
   - Work/career, Intimate relationships, Parenting, Family, Friendships, Health/body, Personal growth, Recreation/fun, Spirituality/meaning, Community
   - Where are the biggest gaps between importance and consistency?

2. **Core questions map.** "What are the 3-5 questions that brought you here? Not intellectual questions — what keeps you up? What do you circle back to?" Write them. Then: "Read them back. Which one makes your chest tighten?"

3. **Baseline snapshot.** Note current state across: sleep quality, energy, emotional range (what emotions have you felt this week?), body awareness, relationship satisfaction, work satisfaction.

**Integration:** "Of everything we mapped today, what surprised you? Not confirmed — surprised." Behavioral commitment: Pennebaker expressive writing (15 min) on "What I'm hoping to understand" — feelings, not analysis, no editing.

### Session 2: Values Archaeology (45 min)

**Warm-up:** 3-minute breathing. "Notice what's present without trying to change it."

**Deep work:**

1. **80th Birthday Speech (ACT).** "Imagine your 80th birthday. Someone who loves you deeply stands up to speak. They don't mention your achievements, titles, or money. They talk about who you were. What do they say?" Write for 10 minutes. No editing.

2. **Bull's Eye values worksheet.** Four domains: Work, Relationships, Personal Growth, Leisure. For each: What matters most? How close am I living to it? (center = on target, edge = far from it)

3. **Trauma-distorted values test.** For each value identified, apply these six tests:
   - "What if it were safe?" — If being visible guaranteed only good outcomes, would you still choose privacy?
   - Approach/avoidance — Am I moving toward something or away from something?
   - Flexibility — Can I express this value flexibly, or is it rigid?
   - Body test — When I imagine violating this "value," what happens in my body? (Mild discomfort vs. panic/freeze)
   - Origin story — When did I first "decide" this mattered? Traceable to survival?
   - Expansion — Does this value grow me or keep me small?

**Integration:** "Which of your values might actually be protective strategies? Don't answer with your head — what does your gut say?" Behavioral commitment: One micro-action this week aligned with a value you identified as genuinely yours.

### Session 3: Mapping Your Operating System (45 min)

**Warm-up:** Body check-in (tension rating by region). "What's your body carrying today that your mind hasn't acknowledged?"

**Deep work:**

1. **Schema identification.** Present these common patterns. For each, ask "Does this feel familiar — not intellectually, but in your bones?"
   - **Mistrust/Abuse:** Others will hurt me if I'm vulnerable
   - **Defectiveness/Shame:** Something is fundamentally wrong with me
   - **Emotional Inhibition:** Feelings are dangerous, stay analytical
   - **Unrelenting Standards:** I must be exceptional or I'm worthless
   - **Self-Sacrifice:** My needs come last
   - **Emotional Deprivation:** No one truly sees or understands me

2. **Trace to origin.** For top 3 schemas: "When did you first learn this? Not the theory — can you remember a specific moment?" Body check after each one.

3. **Coping styles map.** For each schema, identify the dominant coping:
   - Surrender (accept it as true, act accordingly)
   - Avoidance (arrange life to never trigger it)
   - Overcompensation (do the opposite aggressively)

4. **SDT needs check.** Quick assessment: Autonomy (1-10), Competence (1-10), Relatedness (1-10). "Which need is most frustrated right now? What does that frustration feel like?"

**Integration:** "What pattern costs you the most right now — not in theory, but this week?" Behavioral commitment: Journal entry using "what" not "why" — "What patterns protect me? What do they cost me?"

## Phase 2: Pattern Recognition and Emotional Contact

### Session 4: Defense Architecture (50 min)

**Warm-up:** Body scan. Review behavioral commitment from Session 3.

**Deep work:**

1. **4F Trauma Response mapping (Pete Walker).** Map current life situations to:
   - **Fight:** Control, perfectionism, narcissistic defense, "I'll prove them wrong"
   - **Flight:** Workaholism, staying busy, perfectionism, avoiding stillness
   - **Freeze:** Dissociation, numbing, isolation, "I don't care," zoning out (gaming, scrolling)
   - **Fawn:** People-pleasing, over-accommodating, losing yourself in others' needs
   - Which is primary? Secondary? "What does it feel like when each one activates?"

2. **Defense timeline.** "Think of three moments this past week when a defense activated. Walk me through one slowly. What happened just before? What did your body do? What did you actually do? What were you protecting?"

3. **Focusing exercise (15 min).** Gendlin six-step protocol on one of those moments. See exercises.md for full protocol. Key instruction: "The goal is not to understand. It's to sense. If nothing happens, that 'nothing' itself has a texture. Stay with it."

**Integration:** "What surprised you about your defenses — not what confirmed what you already knew?" Behavioral commitment: Log three defense activations this week. For each: situation, body sensation, action taken.

### Session 5: Meeting Your Parts (50 min)

**Warm-up:** Brief meditation. "Close your eyes. Breathe. Notice who shows up inside — not thoughts, but presences."

**Deep work:**

1. **IFS parts identification.** Guide the user to identify 2-3 prominent protector parts. Common ones:
   - The Achiever ("I must be exceptional")
   - The Analyzer ("If I understand it enough, I'll be safe")
   - The Hider ("Don't let them see you")
   - The Firefighter ("Escape to gaming/scrolling/distraction when pain gets close")

2. **Parts dialogue.** For the most prominent part, guide this conversation:
   - "How old is this part? When did it start doing this job?"
   - "What is it protecting you from? What does it believe would happen if it stopped?"
   - "What does it need from you right now?"
   - After each answer: "Where do you feel this part in your body?"

3. **Focusing check.** "Stay with the sensation of this part. Don't analyze it. Just be with it. What happens when you offer it curiosity instead of trying to fix it?"

**Integration:** "What did you learn about this part that you didn't know from analyzing it?" Behavioral commitment: Write a short letter to one protector part, thanking it for its service.

### Session 6: The Inner Critic and the Father's Voice (50 min)

**SAFETY: Read safety.md before this session. Extended safety scaffolding at start.**

**Warm-up:** Grounding first. 5-4-3-2-1 sensory exercise. Establish safety. "You're in control. We can stop any time. You can say 'pause' and we pause."

**Deep work:**

1. **Identify the critic's voice.** "When you fail at something, or consider doing something scary (a sales call, a post, speaking up) — what voice speaks? What does it say, word for word?"

2. **Whose voice is it?** "Listen to the words, the tone. Is this your voice? Or did you learn it from someone?" Body check: "What happens in your body when you hear this voice?"

3. **Map critic's language against father's.** (Only if the user is ready.) "Are there echoes? Not identical words necessarily — but the tone, the effect, the way it makes you feel small or need to hide?"

4. **Shrinking the critic (Pete Walker).** Techniques:
   - "Thought stopping: 'I don't accept this. This is an old recording, not truth.'"
   - "Size it: imagine the critic as a figure. How big is it? Now shrink it. What happens?"
   - "Source it: 'This voice comes from [name/situation]. It doesn't come from reality.'"

5. **Self-compassion stance (Kristin Neff).** Three components:
   - Self-kindness: "What would you say to a friend in this situation?"
   - Common humanity: "How many people carry a voice like this?"
   - Mindfulness: "This is a moment of pain. Not a permanent state."

**Integration:** Distress check (1-10). If above 5, grounding exercise. "What's one counter-statement you can try this week when the critic speaks?" Behavioral commitment: Notice three critic activations this week. Try one counter-statement. Observe what shifts.

### Session 7: Childhood Pattern Deep Dive (50 min)

**SAFETY: Read safety.md. Safety check at start AND end. This is the most emotionally intense session.**

**Warm-up:** Extended grounding. "We're going to look at something that may be tender. You're an adult now. You're safe. We go at your pace."

**Deep work:**

1. **Guided imagery (only if user consents).** "Picture yourself at 7 or 8 years old, in your home. What do you see? What do you hear? What's the feeling in the room?" Process through Pennebaker-style writing — feelings, not analysis.

2. **Pattern connection.** Without forcing: "What in that child's world created the patterns you live with now?"
   - Hiding from father → hiding products/work from the world
   - Being targeted for being visible → avoiding distribution/marketing
   - Managing chaos → being the "only adult in the room" in relationships
   - Earning safety through achievement → unrelenting standards

3. **IFS reparenting.** "Your adult self speaks to your child self. What does that child need to hear? Not advice — what do they need to feel?"

4. **Focusing on what emerged.** "Stay with whatever came up. Don't analyze it. Let it be. What does your body want to do right now?"

**Integration:** Distress check (1-10). **If above 7: grounding protocol (5-4-3-2-1, box breathing, name 5 things you can see).** "What do you need right now?" Behavioral commitment: Something gentle — a walk, a bath, time with someone who feels safe. Not an achievement.

## Phase 3: Integration and Committed Action

### Session 8: From Understanding to Experimentation (45 min)

**Warm-up:** Body scan. Review commitments. "What has shifted since we started? Not what you understand better — what feels different?"

**Deep work:**

1. **ACT defusion practice.** Take a core belief ("Being visible is dangerous"). Rephrase: "I notice I'm having the thought that being visible is dangerous." Then: "Is this thought workable? Does living as if this is true serve my values?"

2. **Design 3-5 behavioral experiments.** For each:
   - What I'll do (specific)
   - When (date/context)
   - What I predict will happen (the fear)
   - What actually happened (fill in after)
   - Example: "Post one technical insight on LinkedIn this week. Prediction: nobody engages, I feel exposed. Observation: \_\_\_"

3. **Implementation intentions.** "When [trigger], instead of [old pattern], I will [new behavior]."
   - "When I feel the urge to analyze instead of act, I will set a 5-minute timer and do the thing."
   - "When the critic says 'don't post that,' I will notice the thought and post anyway."

4. **The 5-minute rule.** "Within 5 minutes of any insight in this program, commit to one micro-action. The insight is worthless without the action."

**Integration:** "Which experiment scares you the most? That's probably the most important one." Behavioral commitment: Complete at least one behavioral experiment before next session.

---

### Session 9: Status and Money Excavation (45 min)

**Warm-up:** Body scan. Review experiments from Session 8.

**Deep work:**

1. **Money chain analysis.** "If you had the money — €10M, whatever the number — what would you do? And then what? And then what?" Repeat until reaching an emotion: safe, worthy, free, loved, enough. That terminal emotion is the actual goal.

2. **Audience identification.** "When you imagine succeeding — really making it — whose face appears? Whose reaction do you imagine? Who are you proving something to?" Body check: what happens when you picture that face?

3. **Five diagnostic questions:**
   - Does achieving milestones bring lasting satisfaction, or does the goalpost shift?
   - When you imagine achievement, whose face appears?
   - Would failure feel like disappointment or annihilation?
   - Do you enjoy the process or only the validation?
   - If no one ever knew about the achievement, would you still pursue it?

4. **ACT Lottery exercise.** "If money were completely irrelevant — you have infinite money — what would you spend your time doing? What about that appeals to you? Those appeals are your values."

**Integration:** "What surprised you? What do you actually want, underneath the money?" Behavioral commitment: One action aligned with the underlying value, not the financial proxy.

### Session 10: Values-Based Life Architecture (45 min)

**Warm-up:** Body scan. Full program review: "We're near the end. How do you arrive today compared to Session 1?"

**Deep work:**

1. **Re-administer values inventory.** Compare to Session 1. What shifted? What clarified?

2. **Personal operating manual.** Document:
   - My core values (genuine, tested against trauma-distortion)
   - My schemas and their triggers
   - My parts and what they protect
   - My primary defense patterns and their body signatures
   - The behavioral experiments that worked
   - The experiments I'm still avoiding (and why)

3. **ACT committed action plan.** For each core value, define three specific actions for the next 30 days. Not vague intentions — specific, dated, observable.

**Integration:** "What's the gap between the life you described at the 80th birthday and the life you're living now? What's one thing you can change this month?" Behavioral commitment: The most important action from the 30-day plan.

---

## Phase 4: Consolidation

### Session 11: Review and Integration (45 min)

Full journey review. Re-administer all baseline measures from Session 1. Compare: emotional vocabulary, body awareness, behavioral experiments completed, defense patterns noticed. Celebrate specific progress. Identify remaining growth edges. Create trigger-response protocol for top 3 patterns.

### Session 12: Forward Architecture (45 min)

Design ongoing practice:

- **Daily (5 min):** Focusing or body scan
- **Weekly (20 min):** Pennebaker expressive writing + behavioral experiment review
- **Monthly (30 min):** Values check-in with Bull's Eye reassessment

Identify specific circumstances requiring professional support. Final exercise: write a letter to yourself from six months in the future, describing what changed because you moved from understanding to action.
