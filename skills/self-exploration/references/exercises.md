## ACT Exercises

### Defusion Techniques

**Naming the story.** When a familiar narrative starts ("I'm not good enough," "It's too risky to be visible"), label it: "Ah, there's the 'not good enough' story again." Don't argue with it. Just notice it as a story.

**"I notice I'm having the thought that..."** Prefix any sticky belief with this phrase. "Being visible is dangerous" becomes "I notice I'm having the thought that being visible is dangerous." Then ask: "Is this workable? Does acting on this thought serve my values?"

**Thoughts on leaves.** Visualize a stream with leaves floating by. Place each thought on a leaf and watch it float downstream. Don't push thoughts away or hold onto them. Just observe them moving.

**The workability test.** Don't ask "Is this true?" — analytically-minded people can argue any position. Instead ask: "Is acting on this thought working for me? Is it moving me toward the life I want?"

### Values Clarification

**80th Birthday Speech.** Write what someone who loves you would say at your 80th birthday — focusing on qualities, not achievements. 10 minutes, no editing.

**Bull's Eye.** Four quadrants: Work, Relationships, Personal Growth, Leisure. Mark where you currently are (center = living your values, edge = far from them). Identify the biggest gap.

**Lottery Exercise.** "If money were completely irrelevant, what would you do with your days? What about that appeals to you?" The appeal is the value.

**Eulogy vs. Resume Values.** List resume values (achievements, titles, metrics) and eulogy values (character, relationships, impact). Which list feels more alive?

### Committed Action

**The 5-minute rule.** Within 5 minutes of any insight during a session, commit to one micro-action. The insight has no value without the action.

**Implementation intentions.** "When [trigger], instead of [old pattern], I will [new behavior]." Be specific. "When I notice the urge to analyze instead of posting, I will set a 5-minute timer and hit publish."

**Values-based action plan.** For each core value, define three specific, dated, observable actions for the next 30 days.

## Focusing (Gendlin) Six-Step Protocol

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes. **Key principle:** The goal is sensing, not understanding.

### Step 1: Clearing a Space (2 min)

"Sit quietly. Ask yourself: 'How is my life going? What is the main thing for me right now?' Don't answer analytically. Wait for what comes in your body. List the issues that come, but don't go into any of them. Just acknowledge each one and set it aside — like placing packages down around you."

### Step 2: Felt Sense (3-5 min)

"Choose one issue from the list. Don't go inside it. Instead, feel the whole of it — the unclear, vague body sense of this whole thing. It will be murky and unclear. That's correct. Stay with the vague, whole, bodily sense. Don't analyze it. Let it be unclear."

**For intellectualizers:** "If you're getting thoughts or explanations, that's your mind trying to help. Thank it and return to the body. The felt sense is NOT a thought. It's a physical thing — in your chest, stomach, throat. It's always more than you can think."

### Step 3: Handle (1-2 min)

"What is the quality of this felt sense? What word, phrase, or image captures it? Try: 'tight,' 'heavy,' 'stuck,' 'like a knot,' 'like fog.' Don't force it. Let the word come FROM the felt sense, not from your analytical mind."

### Step 4: Resonating (2-3 min)

"Go back and forth between the word/image and the felt sense. Does the word fit? Check it against the body. If it fits, you'll feel a slight release — a 'yes, that's it' in the body. If not, let the word change. The body is the authority, not the mind."

### Step 5: Asking (3-5 min)

"Ask the felt sense: 'What is it about this whole thing that makes it so [your handle word]?' Don't answer from your head. Wait for the body to respond. If you get a familiar answer ('because of my father, obviously'), set it aside — that's analysis. Wait for something fresher."

**The felt shift:** "When the right connection happens, you'll feel a physical release — a shift in the body. Like something unlocked. This is the felt shift. It may be subtle. It's always physical."

### Step 6: Receiving (1-2 min)

"Welcome whatever came, even if it's uncomfortable. Don't analyze it yet. Just sit with it. Protect it from the inner critic. This is new material — fresh, not recycled understanding."

**After the exercise:** Note what emerged. Not as analysis — as sensation. "Where did I feel the shift? What word came?"

## IFS Parts Dialogue

### Accessing Self-Energy

"Close your eyes. Breathe slowly. Notice what's present — thoughts, feelings, body sensations. Now imagine stepping back from all of it — not pushing it away, but creating a small space between you and what you're experiencing. That observer space is Self."

**Qualities of Self (the 8 C's):** Curiosity, Compassion, Calm, Clarity, Courage, Connectedness, Creativity, Confidence. If you feel these, you're in Self. If you feel urgency, judgment, or fear, a part has taken over.

### Identifying Parts

**Protector parts (Managers):**

- The Achiever: "I must be exceptional or I'm worthless"
- The Analyzer: "If I understand it fully, I'll be safe"
- The Hider: "Don't let them see you, it's not safe"
- The Controller: "I must manage everything because no one else can"
- The Planner: "If I plan enough, nothing bad will happen"

**Firefighter parts (reactive):**

- The Escaper: Gaming, scrolling, numbing when pain gets close
- The Cynic: "Nothing matters anyway" when vulnerability threatens
- The Overworker: Burying in work to avoid feeling

**Exile parts (wounded):**

- The child who learned hiding keeps you safe
- The child who never felt seen or admired
- The child carrying shame or defectiveness

### The Dialogue Template

To a protector part:

1. "I notice you. I'm curious about you."
2. "How long have you been doing this job?"
3. "What are you protecting me from? What would happen if you stopped?"
4. "What do you need from me?"
5. **Body check:** "Where do I feel this part? What's its physical signature?"
6. "Thank you for protecting me. You've done this for a long time. I'm here now."

**Key warning:** If elaborate internal maps of parts emerge but no emotion is felt, intellectualization has taken over. The question is always: "Am I feeling this part, or thinking about this part?"

## Somatic Exercises

### Body Scan with Emotion Mapping

Rate tension 1-10 in: head, jaw, shoulders, chest, stomach, hands, lower back, legs. For areas with high tension: "If this tension could speak, what would it say?"

### Temperature/Weather Metaphor

"If this emotion were weather, what would it be? A storm? Fog? Blazing sun? Cold stillness?" Bypasses analytical labeling.

### Body Expansion/Contraction Check

"Is your body expanding right now (open, loose, forward-leaning) or contracting (tight, closed, pulling back)?" Track this through the session.

## Writing Exercises

### Pennebaker Expressive Writing

15-20 minutes. Write about your deepest feelings connected to a specific experience. Rules: no editing, no re-reading while writing, feelings not facts, don't worry about grammar or coherence. If stuck, write "I'm stuck" until something comes.

### Letter to a Part

Write a letter to one of your protector parts. Thank it for its service. Tell it what you understand now. Ask it what it needs.

### Letter from Future Self

Write as yourself six months from now, describing what changed because you moved from understanding to action. Be specific.

### Sentence Completion (Bypass Analytical Mind)

Complete rapidly, first thing that comes, no editing:

- "What I really want is..."
- "What I'm afraid of is..."
- "What makes me angry is..."
- "What I never let myself feel is..."
- "If I weren't afraid, I would..."
- "The person whose approval I'm seeking is..."
- "What I'm hiding from is..."
