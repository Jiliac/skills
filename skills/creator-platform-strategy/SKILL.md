# Creator Platform Strategy

Actionable framework for choosing platforms and allocating content creation effort across YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, Instagram, Spotify, and streaming services (Netflix/Prime/Disney+).

## The First Decision: Horizontal or Vertical?

This determines everything. Answer before choosing platforms.

**Horizontal (long-form, 16:9):**

- YouTube is the only real home. Other platforms are accessories.
- Competes with Netflix/Prime, not Instagram/TikTok.
- #1 viewing device is now TV (smart TVs, consoles, Apple TV) -- people watch on the couch.
- Longer videos earn more (completion time > view count for revenue).

**Vertical (short-form, 9:16):**

- MUST publish on all 3: TikTok + YouTube Shorts + Instagram Reels. YouTube alone is insufficient.
- Audiences are completely separate from horizontal -- don't expect conversion.
- Subscriber counts are meaningless (like old Facebook page likes). 2M views with 0 subs, then 200 views next video.
- Biggest sub growth today, but many vertical-first creators now struggle to pivot to horizontal.

## Platform Selection Guide

### YouTube -- The Primary Platform

- Algorithm handles distribution. Cross-posting to other platforms drove <1% of traffic (measured with Bitly over 6 months).
- Now forgives irregular posting (Squeezie, Inoxtag, Mastu all post irregularly and thrive).
- Subscriber count increasingly decorrelated from views. 100K subs can get 2M views/month.
- Dual revenue: AdSense + sponsors. Long-form pays more. Creator-friendly.
- YouTube Shorts = built-in second channel (no longer notifies horizontal subscribers).
- Can cut (not add to) published videos -- saves from legal issues without destroying reach.
- Best creator support: human contacts, positive analytics framing, technical support.

### Twitch -- Community Building

- Best for: low-audience monetization and direct community building.
- If starting from zero today, start on Twitch for community.
- Most mentally demanding: can't take breaks (algorithm punishes absence), can't pre-produce, constant presence required.
- Subscription-based monetization works well even with small audiences.

### TikTok / Instagram -- Reach Without Revenue

- TikTok: good for virality, poor creator monetization ("wrings everyone dry").
- Instagram: no real creator monetization at all. Brand deals only.
- Tibo InShape example: #1 French YouTuber by subs (via Shorts) but horizontal views don't follow.

### Spotify Video -- Wait and See

- Not their core competency. Let others test first.
- Podcast audio on Spotify works well as YouTube companion (car listening vs TV watching).
- Piracy risk: someone uploaded Amixem's entire channel to Spotify without permission.

### Netflix / Amazon Prime / Disney+

- Only worth it if the concept genuinely can't exist on your own YouTube channel.
- Don't sacrifice creative freedom just to be on a platform.
- Prime more aligned with creator-style shows (LOL, game concepts) than Netflix.

## Cross-Platform Decision Framework

Apply these rules in order:

1. **Format first**: Horizontal or vertical? This gates everything.
2. **If horizontal**: YouTube is home. Stop worrying about other platforms for distribution.
3. **If vertical**: Commit to all 3 (TikTok, Shorts, Reels) or don't bother.
4. **Twitch addition**: Consider if community intimacy and low-audience monetization matter to you.
5. **Streaming deals**: Only pursue if the concept cannot exist on your own channel.
6. **Spotify video**: Wait. Let others be the guinea pigs.

## Posting Consistency Rule

Be regular to learn from mistakes faster, NOT to please the algorithm. YouTube no longer punishes breaks. Consistency is a learning accelerator, not an algorithmic requirement.

## Platform Economics at a Glance

| Platform      | Revenue Model       | Creator-Friendliness | Mental Load |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| YouTube       | AdSense + sponsors  | High                 | Medium      |
| Twitch        | Subscriptions       | Medium               | Very High   |
| TikTok        | Creator fund (poor) | Low                  | Medium      |
| Instagram     | Brand deals only    | Very Low             | Low         |
| Spotify       | Early stage         | Unknown              | Low         |
| Netflix/Prime | Production deals    | Low (lose control)   | High        |

## Longevity and Mental Health

- "Durability over Kaizen" -- don't try to beat your last video every time.
- YouTube Studio shows positive comments first -- intentional design to reduce anxiety.
- Twitch is worst for mental health: can't stop, can't pre-produce, constant guilt.
- Province/remote life is viable and protective (Angers works as well as Paris for YouTube).
- Sport as time dilation: perceived 25 min passed, only 10 -- "you found how to slow down time."
