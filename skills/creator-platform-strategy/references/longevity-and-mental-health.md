# Longevity and Mental Health

How different platforms affect creator mental health, and strategies for sustainable careers.

## Mental Health by Platform

### YouTube

- Analytics can be anxiogenic. Joyca documented a burnout caused by stat addiction on his channel.
- YouTube Studio intentionally shows positive comments first -- a design choice to reduce creator anxiety.
- Analytics phrasing is softened ("it will work better next time" instead of harsh failure metrics).
- Still not perfect. When a video underperforms, the instinct is "my career is over" even when rationally you know it's not.
- Bad buzz feels career-ending in the moment but is forgotten within a month by everyone except the creator.
- Bug-caused view drops (-40%) can trigger existential crises before the technical cause is identified.

### Twitch

- Worst platform for mental health among all content platforms.
- Cannot take breaks without algorithmic punishment.
- Cannot pre-produce content (live-only format).
- Constant guilt when not streaming.
- The combination of these three factors creates a mental health trap.

### General Creator Psychology

- When you're fatigued or going through personal issues, even small negative feedback feels catastrophic.
- Conversations with major YouTubers during their "bad buzz" moments: they're convinced it's career-ending, even when outsiders see it as trivial.
- The irrationality is universal and affects even the most experienced creators.

## Sport as Mental Reset

- Amixem (self-described non-sportif) started light jogging.
- Time dilation effect: thought 25 minutes had passed, only 10 minutes had elapsed.
- Realization: "You spend all day complaining about not having enough time. Here, you found how to slow down time."
- In 10-year vision: "master my time and relearn slowness."
