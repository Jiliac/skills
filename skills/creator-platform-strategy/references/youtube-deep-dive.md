# YouTube Deep Dive

Detailed platform-specific strategy for YouTube, the primary platform for horizontal content creators.

## Distribution and Cross-Posting

- Cross-posting to other platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) drove <1% of traffic when measured with Bitly trackers over 6 months. The algorithm handles distribution -- let it work.
- Exception: cross-posting can help when users have multiple devices (see a teaser on Instagram, launch YouTube on TV). This is a recent shift as multi-device households become normal.

## Posting Frequency

- YouTube historically punished irregular posting. This is no longer true.
- Squeezie, Inoxtag, Mastu all post irregularly and maintain strong performance.
- Be regular to learn faster (iterate on mistakes), not to satisfy the algorithm.
- Weekly posting can cannibalize your own videos -- previous video stops getting pushed when the next one drops.

## Subscriber Count vs. Views (Platform Trend)

- Subscriber count is increasingly decorrelated from views.
- 100K subscribers can generate 2M views/month. 9M subscribers doesn't mean proportional views.
- Subscribers are now more like old Facebook page likes -- a vanity metric.
- Still important: it's the first number professionals (agencies, brands) check.

## Viewing Devices

- #1 device for horizontal content is now TV connected devices: smart TVs, consoles (PS5, Xbox), Apple TV, Freebox.
- This shift means horizontal YouTube competes with Netflix/Prime for couch viewing, not with Instagram/TikTok for phone scrolling.
- Long-form content (1 hour+) makes sense when people watch on TV. Nobody wants to watch 1 hour on a phone.
- PC was #1 when Amixem started. Then tablets. Now TV. The shift was unexpected.

## YouTube Shorts (Vertical on YouTube)

- Built-in second channel without managing a separate channel.
- No longer sends notifications to horizontal subscribers (fixed a major annoyance).
- Behind-the-scenes, construction clips, quick moments = Shorts material.
- Some concepts that were horizontal 5 years ago are now clearly Shorts material (e.g., a quick underwater scooter experience).
- Vertical subscribers don't convert to horizontal viewers. Treat as separate audience.

## Secondary Channels

- A secondary channel is a "second front" -- an independent channel with its own algorithmic score.
- Only worth it if you have a passion too niche for your main audience (e.g., ULM flying, RC cars).
- Extremely energy-intensive. Amixem chose not to open one, uses Shorts as his "built-in second channel" instead.

## Video Editing Post-Publication

- You can cut sections from published videos but cannot add content.
- Saves videos from legal issues (e.g., someone requesting removal of their appearance) without deleting the entire video.
- Minor visual glitch (jump cut) but preserves all views and algorithmic momentum.

## Creator Support from YouTube

- Human contacts available -- you can call someone on a Sunday if something goes wrong.
- YouTube Studio (the analytics back-office) shows positive comments first on videos.
- Analytics framing is intentionally less anxiety-inducing than other platforms.
- Occasional paid opportunities (e.g., promoting YouTube Premium) but rare.
- Technical support for bugs (e.g., a -40% views bug was identified and confirmed by YouTube engineering, though it took 2 months).
