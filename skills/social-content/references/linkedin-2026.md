# LinkedIn Algorithm & Format Data — 2026

## Depth Score

The primary ranking signal in 2026. Replaced surface-level engagement metrics.

**Components:**

- **Dwell time**: How long users read/view before scrolling. 61+ seconds = high signal. Now the #1 ranking factor, dethroning likes.
- **Comment depth**: Multi-reply threads >> single reactions or emoji comments.
- **Saves**: Signal lasting reference value. Strong quality indicator.
- **Private shares**: Sending a post via DM = highest perceived value signal.

## Three-Phase Content Evaluation

1. **Quality classifier** (within minutes): Assesses content substance, formatting, author credibility.
2. **Early engagement** (first 30 min): Determines initial distribution scope.
3. **Extended distribution** (if early signals are strong): Pushes to 2nd and 3rd degree connections.

## Timing

- First 30 min determines initial distribution
- First 60-90 min ("golden hour") determines ~70% of total reach
- Respond to comments within 15 min for ~30% engagement boost
- Comments weighted 8x more than likes
- Best posting times: Tue-Thu, 7-8am, 12pm, 5-6pm (test for your audience)

## Format Performance

| Format               | Avg Engagement Rate | Dwell Time | Best For                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-image carousel | 6.60%               | 2-3x text  | Frameworks, comparisons, step-by-step               |
| Document/PDF upload  | 5.85%               | 2-3x text  | Same as carousel                                    |
| Native video         | 5.60%               | Varies     | Demos, face-to-camera, screen share                 |
| Single image + text  | 4.85%               | Low        | Terminal screenshots only (when they prove a claim) |
| Text-only            | ~4.00%              | Moderate   | Argument/thesis posts, opinions                     |

**Key insight**: Single-image posts underperform text-only by 30% in the 2026 algorithm. This is a major shift from prior years. Don't add an image unless it genuinely earns its place.

**Carousel detail**: 278% more engagement than video. 596% more than text-only. 2x higher click-through than single images. The swiping motion increases dwell time, which feeds Depth Score.

## Penalties

| Behavior                                                  | Penalty                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| External links in post body                               | -60% reach                                 |
| Engagement bait ("Comment YES", reaction polls)           | Active suppression                         |
| Link-in-first-comment bridge behavior                     | Similar penalties to in-post links         |
| Low-value carousels (padding dwell time, no real content) | Reduced distribution                       |
| Generic motivational content                              | Deprioritized vs. expertise-backed content |

## What the Algorithm Rewards

- **Relevance**: Match between post topic and viewer's professional interests
- **Expertise**: Demonstrated authority. Practitioners > generic thought leaders.
- **Engagement quality**: Substantive discussion > performative interaction
- **Consistent topic posting**: Builds distribution advantages within professional cohorts
- **Framework-driven posts**: Generate more saves and shares (strong Depth Score signals)

## Post Specs

- Character limit: 3,000 (but optimal is 800-1,500)
- Hook must be under ~210 characters (truncation point before "see more")
- Images: 1200x1200 (square) or 1200x628 (landscape), JPG/PNG, max 5MB
- Carousel: PDF upload, 1080x1080 per slide
- Max 3 hashtags (hashtag walls are penalized)
- No emojis in professional content (algo treats emoji-heavy posts as lower quality)
