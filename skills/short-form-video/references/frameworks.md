# Script Frameworks

8 structures for 15–90 second educational/thought-leadership videos. Every framework follows the meta-pattern: **hook → build → payoff**. Variation is in how tension is created and resolved.

## Hook → Tension → Payoff (HTP) — default

The foundational structure. Best for counterintuitive insights and thought-leadership takes.

- **0:00–0:03** Hook: bold claim, surprising stat, or contrarian statement
- **0:03–0:20** Tension: build stakes, create curiosity gaps, add mini-hooks every 10–15s
- **0:20–0:30** Payoff: deliver the insight, land the takeaway

For 60s videos: extend tension phase, add 2–3 mini-hooks. 65%+ 3-second retention = 4–7× impressions.

## Problem → Agitation → Solution (PAS)

Best for pain-point content when audience doesn't realize severity. Sweet spot: 15–30s.

- **0:00–0:05** Problem: state the pain directly
- **0:05–0:15** Agitation: intensify consequences, make it feel urgent
- **0:15–0:25** Solution: present fix with proof. Keep specific.

Justin Welsh's PAIPS variation: 276K impressions, 371 comments on a single post.

## Myth → Truth → Proof

The contrarian engine. 120% engagement increase over other formats (Atlabs.ai). Best: 30–45s.

- **0:00–0:03** Myth: state common belief boldly ("Everyone says X")
- **0:03–0:15** Truth: reveal the reality ("Here's what actually happens")
- **0:15–0:35** Proof: data, personal experience, or case study. Must substantiate within 10–15s or retention craters.

## Micro-storytelling

Start in medias res — never at the beginning. Zeigarnik effect drives completion. Best: 45–60s. 50% higher engagement (TriVision).

- **0:00–0:03** Action drop: drop into the middle of the story
- **0:03–0:10** Quick context: minimal setup, just enough to follow
- **0:10–0:35** Rising tension: stakes escalate
- **0:35–0:50** Climax: the turning point
- **0:50–0:60** Takeaway: the lesson, delivered cleanly

Jenny Hoyos's "But/Therefore" rule: replace "and then" sequences with "but" (conflict) and "therefore" (consequence). Borrowed from South Park creators.

## List/Listicle

Sets clear expectations, signals brevity. "3 things I learned..." hooks consistently generate millions of views (vidIQ).

- **0:00–0:03** Hook: promise the list ("3 things nobody tells you about X")
- **0:03–0:10** Point 1 (weakest — sets baseline)
- **0:10–0:20** Point 2 (builds)
- **0:20–0:30** Point 3 (strongest — peak emotion at end per Jenny Hoyos's Peak Theory)
- **0:30–0:35** Brief summary or callback

Strongest point LAST. Viewers judge videos by the emotional intensity of the close.

## Before/After Transformation

Visual-first. Dominant on TikTok and Reels where users expect satisfying reveals. Best: 30–45s.

- **0:00–0:05** Before: show the painful/ugly/broken state
- **0:05–0:15** After: reveal the transformation (the "wow" moment)
- **0:15–0:35** Bridge: explain how — the actionable part

Works for: product demos, case studies, process improvements, skill acquisition.

## One Thing

Single focused insight. Simplicity drives completion because viewers can sense the end. Best: 15–30s. Works for daily content cadence.

- **0:00–0:03** Hook: "The one thing that changed X for me"
- **0:03–0:20** Explain the one thing with one supporting example
- **0:20–0:25** Land the takeaway in one sentence

ContentBeta: every 60-second script should explain "one core challenge clearly."

## Tutorial/How-to

Opens with outcome, not process. Best: 30–60s. Strong Shorts retention at 15–30s (OpusClip).

- **0:00–0:03** Outcome promise: show the result first ("Here's what we're building")
- **0:03–0:08** Quick context: who this is for, what you need
- **0:08–0:40** Steps: 2–3 steps with equal time each. Jump cuts between steps.
- **0:40–0:45** Result: show the finished output

One concept per video. Jump cuts between steps, not real-time recording. vidIQ: "How to Create..." hooks generate consistently high views.
