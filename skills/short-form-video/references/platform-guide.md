# Platform Guide: TikTok vs YouTube Shorts vs Instagram Reels

Watch time and completion rate are the #1 signal on all three platforms. Beyond this universal truth, the differences matter for scripting decisions.

## Algorithm Comparison

| Factor                 | TikTok                        | YouTube Shorts            | Instagram Reels             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Top signal**         | Watch time + completion       | Completion rate + replays | Watch time + DM sends       |
| **Highest engagement** | Shares > Comments > Likes     | Subscriptions + replays   | DM sends > Saves > Comments |
| **Length sweet spot**  | 15–60s (21–34s peak)          | 30–60s                    | 60–90s                      |
| **Discovery**          | 90%+ views from non-followers | Explore/exploit model     | Reels = 30.81% reach rate   |
| **Initial test**       | 100–500 users, 1–3 hours      | Similar to TikTok         | Similar, DM shares weighted |

## Audio Strategy

**TikTok**: Trending sounds within 48 hours = 3–5× reach. Use trending audio as background under voiceover when relevant. Export clean files without watermarks for cross-posting.

**YouTube Shorts**: Original audio preferred. Speech is indexed for search — keywords in voiceover matter for discoverability. No trending sound pressure.

**Instagram Reels**: Mixed strategy. Trending audio boosts Explore placement. Business accounts face music licensing limitations — original audio may be safer.

**Cross-post default**: Use original audio. Add trending sound only for TikTok-first posts.

## Hashtag Strategy

**TikTok**: 3–5 hashtags (max 5 since July 2025). Use TikTok's categorization tool. Mix broad + niche.

**YouTube Shorts**: 2–3 keyword-rich hashtags. Title matters more than hashtags for discovery.

**Instagram Reels**: 3–5 hashtags. Shifted from discovery to context verification — algorithm uses them to confirm content category, not as primary discovery.

## CTA Strategy

### Dual Delivery (Non-Negotiable)

Every CTA must be delivered through both channels simultaneously:

- **Spoken**: voiceover/on-camera delivers the CTA verbally
- **Text overlay**: reinforces on screen at the same moment

Single-channel CTAs underperform. The text overlay catches muted viewers; the spoken word catches those not reading overlays.

### Placement: Mid-Roll + End-Roll

- **Mid-roll CTA (~50% mark)**: Often outperforms end-roll because not all viewers reach the end. Embed naturally — "Save this for later" mid-explanation, not as an interruption.
- **End-roll CTA (final 3–5s)**: For viewers who watched to completion — highest-intent audience. Stronger ask acceptable here.
- Always deliver value before any CTA. Premature asks = swipe-away.

### Platform-Specific CTAs

**TikTok**: Subtle, conversational. "Save this" is the dominant CTA (saves = high-weight signal). "Follow for Part 2" is one of the most effective CTAs. Comment-driving formats work well (shares > comments > likes):

- Open-ended questions: "What would you add?"
- Poll-style: "Which one are you — A or B?"
- Debate starters: "Agree or disagree?"
- Experience sharing: "Has this happened to you?"

**YouTube Shorts**: "Subscribe" is the default CTA. Link to long-form content when applicable. Subscriptions + replays are the highest-weight engagement.

**Instagram Reels**: "Send this to a friend" / "Share this" drives DM sends — the single strongest signal per Mosseri (January 2025). Save-baiting also effective.

**Cross-post default**: Use "Save this" (works everywhere), add platform-specific CTA swap in EDIT NOTES column.

### Save-Baiting as a Structural Decision

Making content genuinely save-worthy is a scripting decision, not just a CTA phrase. Structure the content itself to be reference-worthy:

- **Lists and frameworks** — "3 steps to..." inherently earns saves
- **Step-by-step processes** — viewers save to revisit later
- **Templates and formulas** — actionable formats viewers want to reuse
- **Specific numbers/stats** — concrete data is save-worthy; vague advice is not

If the content isn't structured to be save-worthy, "Save this" as a CTA will underperform.

### Bio Link Strategy

25–40% higher conversion with optimized link-in-bio pages vs. raw URLs.

- Limit to 5–8 links maximum (more = decision paralysis)
- Top link = current campaign/priority
- Reference in CTAs: "Link in bio" (Instagram/TikTok) but never as the primary CTA — always pair with an in-platform action first

## Captions & Safe Zones

**Captions are mandatory on all platforms.** 85% watched muted. Captions boost: view time +12%, views +7–40%, completion likelihood +80%.

**Safe zones** (critical text must stay inside):

| Platform           | Top reserve              | Bottom reserve               | Safe area               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| TikTok             | Minimal                  | 320–480px (icons + captions) | ~900×1400px centered    |
| YouTube Shorts     | 120–380px (channel info) | 300–380px (buttons)          | ~900×1200px centered    |
| Instagram Reels    | Minimal                  | 250–420px                    | ~900×1400px centered    |
| **Universal safe** | Keep 200px clear         | Keep 400px clear             | **900×1400px centered** |

## Cross-Posting Strategy

1. **Create for primary platform first** (usually TikTok for reach, Shorts for YouTube growth, Reels for Instagram audience)
2. **Export clean files** — no watermarks. Instagram actively detects/suppresses TikTok watermarks.
3. **Stagger posts**: TikTok first → YouTube Shorts 2–4 hours later → Reels 2–4 hours after that
4. **Adjust per platform**:
   - Swap CTA text in final overlay
   - Adjust length if needed (trim for TikTok, extend for Reels)
   - Add trending audio for TikTok version only
   - Adjust hashtags per platform norms
5. **Note cross-post adjustments in EDIT NOTES column** of the script

## Posting Frequency

| Platform        | Minimum  | Growth mode                | Diminishing returns |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| TikTok          | 3–5/week | 1–3 daily                  | Beyond daily        |
| YouTube Shorts  | 3–5/week | 12+/month = 53% more views | Beyond 5/week       |
| Instagram Reels | 3–5/week | + daily Stories            | Beyond daily        |

Buffer (11M+ posts): biggest marginal lift from 1 → 2–5 posts/week. Quality > quantity always.
