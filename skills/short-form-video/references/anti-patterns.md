# Anti-Patterns & Benchmarks

## 13 Mistakes Ranked by Impact

### 1. Slow hooks (catastrophic)

First 3 seconds determine 80% of algorithmic success. No greetings, no preamble, no logos. A SaaS firm cut their intro animation → +12% view-through rate. 70% of audience gone if interesting point is at 15–20s.

### 2. Failing to optimize for completion rate

Watch-through >50% carries 4× more algorithmic weight than likes. 30s Short at 85% completion beats 60s Short at 50%. Structure for watch-to-end with re-hooks every 5–7s.

### 3. Missing text overlays and captions

Captions: +12% view time, +7–40% views, 80% more likely to watch to end. 85% of video is watched muted. Non-negotiable.

### 4. Over-production

43% of creators: behind-the-scenes outperforms polished. Native/unpolished beats cinematic on TikTok. Sweet spot: good audio (non-negotiable) + authentic delivery + intentional editing. Not cinematic.

### 5. Repurposing long-form without reformatting

74% better performance with intelligent restructuring vs. simple clipping. Need: new hooks, vertical reframing, captions, text overlays, adjusted pacing, standalone narrative arc.

### 6. Wrong pacing for the platform

TikTok-native: rapid cuts 0.5–2s. Educational talking head: 3–5s changes. Tutorial: 5–10s. Using one pacing style across all content types kills retention.

### 7. Premature engagement asks

Asking for likes/follows before delivering value. Viewer hasn't received anything yet — no reason to act. Deliver value first, CTA after.

### 8. Weak endings / signaling the end

"In conclusion," "to wrap up," "that's all" — kills loops and triggers swipe-away. End with energy, a callback, or a question that loops. Never signal you're done.

### 9. No clear single takeaway

Cramming 5 ideas into 60 seconds. Viewer retains nothing. One core idea per video. 2–3 supporting points max.

### 10. Text in unsafe zones

Bottom 320–480px on TikTok, bottom 300–380px on Shorts/Reels covered by platform UI. Text there is invisible. Use the 900×1400px centered safe zone.

### 11. Ignoring trending audio (TikTok)

Trending sounds within 48 hours = 3–5× reach on TikTok. Not always applicable for educational content, but when a trending sound fits, use it.

### 12. Too many CTAs or messages

One CTA per video. One topic per video. Multiple asks = no action. Multiple topics = no retention.

### 13. Generic undifferentiated advice

"Work harder," "be consistent," "just start." No specificity = no save, no share, no follow. Specificity drives saves. Frameworks and steps drive shares.

## Performance Benchmarks

### Completion Rate

| Level     | TikTok               | YouTube Shorts | Instagram Reels    |
| --------- | -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Average   | ~40–50%              | ~73%           | ~40–50% (3s hold)  |
| Good      | 60%+                 | 80%+           | 60%+ (3s hold)     |
| Excellent | 80%+ (viral trigger) | 85%+           | 70%+ (5–10× reach) |

### Engagement Rate

| Platform        | Average    | Small accounts (<100K) | Note                    |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| YouTube Shorts  | 5.91%      | Higher                 | Highest among platforms |
| TikTok          | 3.85–4.9%  | 7.50%                  | Educational: 7.36%      |
| Instagram Reels | 1.23–2.46% | Higher                 | 30.81% reach rate       |

### Views-to-Followers Ratio

- 1× = escaped follower bubble
- 2–5× = strong algorithmic distribution
- 5–10× = viral
- 10×+ = mega-viral

### Posting Frequency Impact

- 1 → 2–5 posts/week = biggest marginal lift (Buffer, 11M+ posts)
- 12+/month = 53% more views, 66% more subscribers (vidIQ, 5M channels)
- Beyond daily = diminishing returns
- 3 excellent/week > 7 mediocre/week
