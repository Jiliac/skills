# Hook Patterns — The 3-Channel System

50–60% of all viewer drop-offs happen in the first 3 seconds. On Instagram, average decision time is 1.7 seconds. The hook must work across visual, audio, and text overlay simultaneously.

## Visual Hooks

Create pattern interrupts that break the scroll:

- **Snap zoom / whip pan** — sudden camera movement
- **Strong facial expression** — urgency, surprise, frustration (brains are wired for faces)
- **Start mid-action** — never at the beginning, show the payoff first
- **Unexpected prop or environment** — anything that breaks pattern
- **Movement in frame** — static = scroll. Videos with frequent scene changes: +32% retention.

Key principle (vidIQ): show the payoff, not the setup.

## Audio Hooks

Assume 85% start muted. When sound is on:

- **First words must promise value or surprise.** No warming up. Confident, direct.
- **SFX at video start** — subtle click, whoosh, or notification ping enhances attention
- **Silence-then-speech** — pattern interrupt in noisy feeds
- **Voice tone shift** — start louder/faster than normal conversational tone

## Text Overlay Hooks

Non-negotiable for sound-off viewing. 3–7 words, high-contrast, large font, hold 2s+.

Effective categories:

- **Bold claim**: "This changed everything"
- **Question**: "What if you've been doing it wrong?"
- **Numbers/stats**: "I grew 400% in 90 days"
- **Curiosity gap**: "The one thing every CEO knows but won't say"
- **Self-identifying**: "Are you still doing X manually?" (niche educational — very effective)

## The Combined Formula

vidIQ's 3-part framework — all three fire simultaneously in the first 1–3 seconds:

1. **Visual hook** — surprising frame, strong emotion, or result shown
2. **Text hook** — 3–7 words that sharpen the promise
3. **Verbal hook** — 5–10 words delivering the promise clearly

Test: watch your video muted — does it hook? Listen without watching — does it hook? If either works alone, the combined effect will be powerful (Brandefy).

## George Blackman's Hook Formula (Educational Content)

**Target → Transformation → Stakes** — specifically designed for educational/thought-leadership hooks:

1. **Target**: Who is this for? Self-identify the viewer in the first words. ("If you're sending cold emails...")
2. **Transformation**: What will they gain or change? The promised outcome. ("...here's how to 3× your reply rate...")
3. **Stakes**: Why now? What's at risk if they scroll? ("...before your pipeline dries up.")

More specific than general curiosity hooks. Works especially well for niche educational content where the audience self-selects. Combine with the 3-channel system: Target in text overlay, Transformation spoken, Stakes implied visually.

## Proven Hook Phrases

For educational/thought-leadership content:

- "Stop doing X" / "I stopped doing X and here's what happened"
- "Nobody talks about this" / "Here's what nobody tells you about X"
- "The real reason X doesn't work"
- "I spent [time] learning X — here's the one thing that matters"
- "X vs Y" comparisons
- "You're doing X wrong" (must be specific, not vague)
- "Here's what I learned after [specific experience]"
- "Did you know...?" + surprising stat
- "[Bold contrarian claim]"

vidIQ data: "Have you heard about..." (16M views), "They don't want you to know..." (21M views), "I never do THIS" (33M views), "Did you know that...?" (31M views).

## Hook Killers (never do these)

- **Greetings**: "Hey guys, welcome back" — #1 killer per vidIQ
- **Logos/bumpers**: A SaaS firm cut their intro animation → +12% view-through rate
- **Buried lede**: interesting point at 15–20s = 70% of audience already gone
- **Clickbait mismatch**: promising what content doesn't deliver destroys long-term trust
- **Vague hooks**: "You're doing TikTok wrong" lacks specificity for genuine curiosity
- **Throat clearing**: "So, um, today I wanted to talk about..." — instant swipe

## The Retention Cascade

- **1–3s**: scroll-or-stay decision
- **3s**: algorithmic checkpoint — determines broader distribution
- **70%+ 3-second retention** → 4–7× more impressions
- **47% of total campaign value** created in first 3 seconds (Facebook/Nielsen)
- Extra 10% retention = difference between 100K and 1M views (Paddy Galloway)
