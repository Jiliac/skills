# Short-Form Video Scripting

Write fully annotated, production-ready scripts for 15–90 second videos. Based on data from 3.3B+ Shorts views (Paddy Galloway), 35B Shorts views (vidIQ), and frameworks from Jenny Hoyos, George Blackman, and Brendan Kane.

## Required Inputs

Before scripting, gather or confirm:

1. **Topic/core idea** — The single insight, lesson, or argument. One idea per video.
2. **Platform** — TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, or cross-post. Affects length, audio, CTA.
3. **Production style** — Talking head, faceless/voiceover, tutorial/screen share, story/vlog, or hybrid.
4. **Context** (optional) — Series position, audience level, specific CTA goal, trending audio to use.

If the user hasn't specified platform or style, ask. Default to hybrid style and cross-post if unspecified.

## Core Principles (ranked by impact)

### 1. The hook is a 3-channel simultaneous system

71% of viewers decide in 3 seconds. The hook must work across visual + text overlay + audio simultaneously, all reinforcing one message. No greetings, no setup, no logos.

See [hooks.md](references/hooks.md) for the combined hook formula and proven patterns.

### 2. Optimize every decision for completion rate

Completion rate is the #1 algorithm signal on all platforms. A 30s video at 85% completion beats a 60s video at 50%. Default to the minimum length that delivers the insight (30–45s for single concepts). Structure for watch-to-end, not just watch-to-start.

### 3. Pattern interrupts every 5–8 seconds

Visual changes every 2–4 seconds. Re-hook the viewer with jump cuts, zoom shifts, B-roll insertions, text overlays, tonal shifts, or SFX. One creator reported 40% retention increase from optimizing clip lengths alone.

See [pacing-retention.md](references/pacing-retention.md) for cadence rules and loop structure.

### 4. Every second must be annotated

The 6-column format (TIME | VISUAL | VOICEOVER | TEXT OVERLAY | AUDIO/SFX | EDIT NOTES) must be fully populated. Sparse scripts produce mediocre videos. The script IS the production plan.

See [script-format.md](references/script-format.md) for the full format, vocabulary, and example scripts.

### 5. Captions and text overlays are non-negotiable

85% of social video is watched muted. Captions boost view time by 12% and make viewers 80% more likely to watch to the end. Reinforce key spoken phrases with text overlays — bold claims, stats, takeaways.

## Framework Selection

Default to Hook → Tension → Payoff. Match to content:

| Framework                | Duration | Best for                         |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| **HTP** (default)        | 30–60s   | Insights, counterintuitive takes |
| **PAS**                  | 15–30s   | Pain-point content, positioning  |
| **Myth → Truth → Proof** | 30–45s   | Contrarian thought leadership    |
| **Micro-storytelling**   | 45–60s   | Personal lessons, case studies   |
| **List/Listicle**        | 30–45s   | Practical tips, value delivery   |
| **Before/After**         | 30–45s   | Results, transformations         |
| **One Thing**            | 15–30s   | Daily content, single insights   |
| **Tutorial**             | 30–60s   | Teaching, processes              |

See [frameworks.md](references/frameworks.md) for timing breakdowns and structural details.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess inputs

Confirm topic, platform, production style. Identify the single takeaway the viewer should remember.

### Step 2: Select framework + duration

Match framework to content type. Set duration based on framework sweet spot and platform:

- TikTok: 21–34s highest completion, 15–60s range
- YouTube Shorts: 30–60s, algorithm rewards reaching 30s mark
- Instagram Reels: 60–90s for max views

### Step 3: Write the hook (3 channels)

Specify simultaneously: what the viewer SEES (visual direction), READS (text overlay, 3–7 words), and HEARS (first spoken words, 5–10 words). All three reinforce one message.

### Step 4: Write the full annotated script

Use the 6-column format with header block. Populate every column for every time segment. Visual changes every 2–4s. Pattern interrupts every 5–8s. Voiceover at 150–170 WPM for educational content.

See [script-format.md](references/script-format.md) for column definitions and annotation vocabulary.

### Step 5: Add CTA + ending

Default to soft CTA ("Save this," "Follow for more"). Place a mid-roll CTA at ~50% and end CTA in final 3–5s. For TikTok: design a loop-friendly ending (no "in conclusion"). Match CTA to platform norms.

See [platform-guide.md](references/platform-guide.md) for platform-specific CTA norms.

### Step 6: Write posting metadata

- **Caption/post copy** for the platform
- **Hashtags**: 3–5, platform-appropriate
- **Cross-posting notes** if multi-platform (what to change)

### Step 7: Self-check

Before presenting:

- [ ] Hook lands in under 3 seconds? All 3 channels (visual + text + audio) specified?
- [ ] One core idea only? Single clear takeaway?
- [ ] Duration matches framework sweet spot AND platform?
- [ ] Visual change every 2–4 seconds? Pattern interrupt every 5–8 seconds?
- [ ] Every column populated for every time segment?
- [ ] Text overlays reinforce key spoken points? 3–7 words each, 1.5s+ on screen?
- [ ] Voiceover word count matches duration? (~75w/30s, ~110w/45s, ~150w/60s)
- [ ] All text within safe zones? (900×1400px centered in 1080×1920)
- [ ] CTA embedded naturally, not appended? Matches platform norm?
- [ ] No greetings, no preamble, no slow setup, no "in conclusion"?
- [ ] Loop-friendly ending for TikTok?
- [ ] Reading level at 5th grade or below?

## Output Format

Present each script as:

```
**Title:** [title]
**Platform:** [platform(s)]
**Framework:** [framework used]
**Duration:** [Xs]
**Style:** [production style]

---

[6-column annotated script table]

---

**Caption:** [platform post copy]
**Hashtags:** [3–5 hashtags]
**Cross-post notes:** [adjustments for other platforms, if applicable]

**Word count (voiceover):** [N words]
**Estimated completion rate signal:** [based on length + structure]
```

## Anti-Patterns (never do these)

- Start with greetings, logos, intros, or "Hey guys welcome back"
- Bury the interesting point past 3 seconds
- Leave any column empty — sparse scripts produce bad videos
- Use static talking head for 30+ seconds without visual change
- Signal the ending ("In conclusion," "To wrap up") — kills loops
- Ask for likes/follows before delivering value
- Repurpose long-form by simple clipping without new hooks + restructuring
- Over-produce (cinematic > authentic on social platforms)
- Place text in unsafe zones (bottom 320px TikTok, bottom 300px Shorts/Reels)
