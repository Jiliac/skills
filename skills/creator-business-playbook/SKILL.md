# Creator Business Playbook

Battle-tested strategies from Amixem (Maxime), one of France's top YouTubers (~10M subs, 13+ years on YouTube, 30+ employees, multiple side ventures). Extracted from his GDYI podcast interview.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:

- Building or scaling a content creator business
- Designing a revenue/monetization strategy for YouTube or similar platforms
- Negotiating or structuring sponsor deals
- Scaling a creative team from solo to 30+ people
- Deciding whether to internalize production vs outsource
- Diversifying beyond content into physical products or food
- Seeking mindset advice on creator longevity and burnout prevention

## Core Principles

### 1. Dual Revenue Engine

YouTube AdSense (pre-rolls, mid-rolls, post-rolls) + integrated brand sponsorships. Neither alone is sufficient. Longer videos earn more per video regardless of view count -- a 1h documentary outearns a 15min viral hit.

### 2. Annual Sponsor Contracts for Stability

Sign 4-6 sponsor deals at the start of each year. This secures 4-6 months of treasury/runway. Covid proved that pre-signed annual contracts are lifesavers when the market collapses overnight.

### 3. Creative Independence from Sponsors

Never let brands dictate or inspire concepts. "Who loves us, follows us." Accept sponsors into existing concepts, not the reverse. This prevents creative interference and preserves audience trust.

### 4. Internalize Everything

Own your crew, equipment, sets, and even set construction. Province locations (Angers) provide massive cost arbitrage -- monthly facility cost equals a half-day rental in Paris. Salaried comedians ensure always-available talent.

### 5. Rule of 3 Scaling

Team complexity jumps at thresholds: solo -> 3 (first conflicts) -> 9-10 (need managers) -> 30 (managers of managers, politics emerge) -> 100+. At 30, the founder can finally refocus on core value-add (making content).

### 6. Durability Over Kaizen

Stop raising the bar every year. Marathon, not sprint. The 2022 epiphany (10 years in): shift from "this could end Tuesday" to a stability mindset. Profitable videos subsidize passion projects -- not every video needs its own P&L.

### 7. Diversify with Control

Stay majority shareholder in all ventures. Diversification provides financial safety net if content stops. Joint-venture model (locked partnerships with no exit) forces compromise over separation.

## Quick Decision Framework

| Decision                        | Guidance                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How long should videos be?      | Longer = more ad breaks = more revenue per video.                                                                                            |
| Freelancers or permanent staff? | CDI (permanent contracts) for core crew. Builds loyalty, enables province recruiting.                                                        |
| Paris or province?              | Province for cost arbitrage and independence. Accept the guest logistics trade-off.                                                          |
| One video at a loss?            | Fine -- profitable videos subsidize passion projects across the year.                                                                        |
| Brand wants creative control?   | Refuse. Integrate sponsors into your concepts, never build concepts around sponsors.                                                         |
| When to build custom studios?   | When you're "pushing walls" -- current space limits concepts. Budget 2-6M for purpose-built facility.                                        |
| How to diversify?               | Adjacent ventures: food (JV with operator), merch (pivot from textile to higher-margin goods), agency (internalize your own representation). |
