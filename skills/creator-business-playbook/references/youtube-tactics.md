# YouTube Platform Tactics

## Thumbnail & Title First (MrBeast Method)

Validated by MrBeast and adopted by Amixem:

- Refuse to enter production if the title + thumbnail combo isn't validated
- The "packaging" (title/thumbnail) is completely separate from the artistic content
- Best performing thumbnail is usually the one you didn't want to put
- Test 2-4 thumbnails and let data decide
- A/B testing is built into YouTube

### Amixem's Approach

- If there's no hook/title, don't proceed
- "I've lived through too many videos I was proud of that didn't perform because of bad packaging"
- Decouple artistic pride from packaging pragmatism
- Boundary: won't use misleading or inappropriate thumbnails (no nudity clickbait)

## Long-Form vs Short-Form (Horizontal vs Vertical)

Critical decision for new creators:

- Subscribers gained through vertical content (Shorts/Reels/TikTok) will NOT convert to horizontal viewers
- Subscribers from horizontal won't watch vertical
- Currently, fastest subscriber growth worldwide comes from vertical content
- But vertical doesn't build the same revenue or stability as horizontal

### Tibo InShape Example

- #1 French YouTuber by subscriber count
- Growth driven primarily by vertical/Shorts content
- Horizontal view counts don't follow proportionally
- Illustrates the decoupling of subscriber count from horizontal engagement

### Subscriber Count Is Misleading

- Subscribers are "likes from the old Facebook era"
- Can have 100K subscribers and do 2M views per video
- Can have 10M subscribers and do the same views as at 6M
- First metric professionals look at, but functionally decorrelated from actual reach
- Still worth asking audience to subscribe (it's free support, matters for brand perception)

## Publishing Strategy

### Frequency

- Old YouTube: punished irregular publishing
- New YouTube: forgives breaks, rewards quality over quantity
- Squeezie publishes irregularly -- still performs well
- Be regular not for the algorithm but to learn faster (especially when starting out)

### Timing

- Amixem: 17h25 every Sunday
- Old theory: what matters is the day AFTER publication (next-day algorithm push)
- New reality: if the algorithm decides a video should work, it works regardless of publish time
- Need minimum ~5-10K initial views for the algorithm to have enough data to evaluate

### Cross-Platform Promotion

- Tracked with Bitly links for 6 months
- Result: less than 1% of YouTube views came from other social media announcements
- Stopped cross-posting for years
- Recently resumed for important projects only
- YouTube's algorithm is self-sufficient for distribution

## Algorithm Insights

### Slow Burn vs Spike

- Some videos spike in 48h then die
- Some videos have terrible launches but become the most-viewed ever (slow algorithm push over years)
- "Don't try to understand too much" -- the algorithm's behavior is unpredictable
- A bad launch doesn't mean a bad video

### Device Shift

- Evolution: PC fixed -> tablet -> connected TV (current #1)
- TV (smart TVs, consoles, Freebox, Apple TV, PS5, Xbox) is now the primary viewing device
- Long-form horizontal content benefits enormously from TV viewing
- "Nobody wants to watch a 1-hour video on a phone"

## YouTube as a Platform

### Creator Relations

- One of the few platforms with dedicated human contacts for creators
- Direct phone line for emergencies (even on Sundays)
- YouTube Studio surfaces positive comments first -- intentional design to protect mental health
- Analytics presented in less anxiety-inducing framing than other platforms

### Comparison with Other Platforms

- **Twitch**: punishes irregular streaming, most mentally demanding creator format (live, can't pre-produce)
- **TikTok**: different creator respect/support policy
- **Instagram**: doesn't even monetize creators properly
- **Spotify**: experimenting with video, but not their core competency (wait and see)

## Secondary Channel Strategy

Amixem's position: don't open a second front.

- A secondary channel is a fully independent channel with its own algorithmic reputation
- It's not overflow from the main channel -- it requires its own investment
- YouTube Shorts on the main channel serves as a "secondary channel" without the overhead
- Only worth it for genuinely separate content niches (e.g., a niche hobby unrelated to main content)

## Netflix/Streaming Platform Opportunity

- In discussions primarily with Amazon Prime (more aligned with show/concept formats)
- Netflix less naturally suited to creator-style concepts
- Key rule: only do it for concepts that genuinely can't exist on YouTube
- Refuse to sacrifice creative freedom just for platform prestige
- Kaizen (Inoxtag) on Disney+ is a reference point
