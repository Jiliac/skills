# Mindset & Longevity

## Durability Over Kaizen

The most important mindset shift for long-term creator success:

- Stop raising the bar every year. Constant escalation kills creators.
- "I've seen many people in many domains tell themselves: I did this, now I must do better, must do better."
- A marathon, not a sprint. Basic phrase, but fundamental.
- Not every video needs to top the last one -- that's impossible (except for rare geniuses like Mister V)

## The 2022 Epiphany (10 Years In)

After 10 years of YouTube (2012-2022), a critical mindset shift:

- **Before 2022**: "This could stop Tuesday. YouTube doesn't need Amixem."
- **After 2022**: "We can stop telling ourselves it's going to end next Tuesday."
- Triggered by reaching the 10-year milestone -- proof of durability
- Shifted focus from survival mode to stability mode
- Enabled long-term thinking: permanent hires, studio construction, annual sponsor contracts

## War Chest Philosophy

From father (entrepreneur in electromenager who survived 2008 crisis):

- "Have a war chest" -- 4-6 months of runway minimum
- When you recruit someone who relocated for the job, you owe them stability
- Annual sponsor contracts pre-signed = guaranteed runway even if market crashes
- Covid validated this approach: sponsors with physical retail disappeared overnight

## Creative Process & Avoiding Burnout

### Ideation Retreats

- 2-day solo retreats at the seaside
- Cut all notifications, all social media
- Watch series, consume inspiration, let ideas percolate
- Ideas accumulate in a note over 3-4 months, then get shaped during retreats

### The 3-Week Filter

- Write 10 concepts in a burst of enthusiasm
- Wait 2-3 weeks
- Only 4-5 survive the cooling period
- "It hurts at the time of writing to think I'll find this stupid in 3 weeks. But I do."
- Pre-filter before sharing with production team

### Planning Rhythm

- Plan 6 months ahead
- First 2-3 months locked in
- Remaining months more flexible
- Production team asks about later concepts; if you're dragging your feet, it's a signal

## Time as the Ultimate Constraint

The primary creative limit is not money but time:

- Never travel more than 5 days for a shoot (1 day travel, 1 day setup/teardown, 2-3 days filming)
- Protect work-life balance (has children)
- Guilt about "non-productive" time is real but counterproductive
- Watching a series for inspiration feels like slacking but is the most important work

## On Bad Buzz and Resilience

- Severity of a bad buzz depends more on your emotional state than the actual event
- When tired or going through personal issues, a minor criticism feels career-ending
- Rational friends will tell you "it's nothing, in a month it's forgotten"
- But when you're in the fire: "It's over, we close the curtain, thank you, goodbye"
- This is completely irrational but universal among creators

## Regulatory Mindset

### Assemblee Nationale Visit

- Went to educate deputies about the creator economy
- Not lobbying for special treatment -- education about what the job actually is
- "My job is not being a Snapchatter in Dubai. It's being in Angers, employing people."
- Resulted in new NAF code for "online content creator"

### Repression des Fraudes Visit

- Welcomed the inspection: "I've been waiting 10 years for someone to come verify we do things seriously"
- Result: 150 EUR fine for a missing comma in an invoice
- Frustration: serious operators get inspected while offshore bad actors remain untouched
- Lesson: document everything, be transparently compliant, welcome audits

## 10-Year Vision

- "Master my time and relearn slowness"
- No lassitude with content creation despite 13+ years
- Preparing structures for potential departure (diversified businesses)
- Dream scenario: continue as animator/entertainer only, sell the production/business side
- "If I could only do documentaries, I'd be very happy"
- Pixar as the ultimate inspiration: double-reading content (jokes for adults AND kids in every video)
