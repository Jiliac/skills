# Mindset & Longevity

## Durability Over Kaizen

The most important mindset shift for long-term creator success:

- Stop raising the bar every year. Constant escalation kills creators.
- "I've seen many people in many domains tell themselves: I did this, now I must do better, must do better."
- A marathon, not a sprint. Basic phrase, but fundamental.
- Not every video needs to top the last one -- that's impossible (except for rare geniuses like Mister V)

## The 2022 Epiphany (10 Years In)

After 10 years of YouTube (2012-2022), a critical mindset shift:

- **Before 2022**: "This could stop Tuesday. YouTube doesn't need Amixem."
- **After 2022**: "We can stop telling ourselves it's going to end next Tuesday."
- Triggered by reaching the 10-year milestone -- proof of durability
- Shifted focus from survival mode to stability mode
- Enabled long-term thinking: permanent hires, studio construction, annual sponsor contracts

## War Chest Philosophy

From father (entrepreneur in electromenager -- kitchens and home appliances -- who survived 2008 crisis):

- "Have a war chest" -- 4-6 months of runway minimum
- When you recruit someone who relocated for the job, you owe them stability
- Annual sponsor contracts pre-signed = guaranteed runway even if market crashes
- Covid validated this approach: sponsors with physical retail disappeared overnight

### Entrepreneurial DNA

- Parents were entrepreneurs in electromenager (kitchens and home appliances)
- Survived the 2008 financial crisis (nearly lost everything)
- Father's advice: "Never be an entrepreneur" (ironic) + "Always have a war chest"
- In the 1990s, entrepreneurship without family precedent was nearly unthinkable in France
- The "apple doesn't fall far from the tree" -- grew up seeing the entrepreneur lifestyle firsthand

## On Bad Buzz and Resilience

- Severity of a bad buzz depends more on your emotional state than the actual event
- When tired or going through personal issues, a minor criticism feels career-ending
- Rational friends will tell you "it's nothing, in a month it's forgotten"
- But when you're in the fire: "It's over, we close the curtain, thank you, goodbye"
- This is completely irrational but universal among creators

## Regulatory Mindset

### Assemblee Nationale Visit

- Went to educate deputies about the creator economy
- Not lobbying for special treatment -- education about what the job actually is
- "My job is not being a Snapchatter in Dubai. It's being in Angers, employing people."
- Resulted in new NAF code for "online content creator"

### Repression des Fraudes Visit

- Welcomed the inspection: "I've been waiting 10 years for someone to come verify we do things seriously"
- Result: 150 EUR fine for a missing comma in an invoice
- Frustration: serious operators get inspected while offshore bad actors remain untouched
- Lesson: document everything, be transparently compliant, welcome audits

## 10-Year Vision

- "Master my time and relearn slowness"
- No lassitude with content creation despite 13+ years
- Preparing structures for potential departure (diversified businesses)
- Dream scenario: continue as animator/entertainer only, sell the production/business side
- "If I could only do documentaries, I'd be very happy"
- Pixar as the ultimate inspiration: double-reading content (jokes for adults AND kids in every video)
