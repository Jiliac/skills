# Revenue & Sponsor Strategy

## Dual Revenue Model

Two revenue streams, both essential:

1. **YouTube AdSense** -- automatic ads inserted by YouTube
   - Pre-rolls (before video)
   - Mid-rolls (during video, more breaks in longer content)
   - Post-rolls (after video)
   - Key insight: longer videos = more mid-roll slots = higher per-video revenue
   - A 1h documentary earns more than a 15min video even with fewer total views
   - Completion rate and watch time matter more than raw view count

2. **Integrated Brand Sponsorships** -- creator reads sponsor segment in-video
   - Transparent, assumed, explained to audience ("merci a notre partenaire X")
   - Not product placement (hidden brand in background) -- it's a direct, honest segment
   - Typically 30-60 seconds at the start of the video

Neither stream alone sustains a 30-person production company. Both together provide stability.

## Annual Contract Strategy

Sign 4-6 major sponsor contracts at the start of each year:

- Secures 4-6 months of treasury/runway before producing a single video
- Multiple videos pre-purchased across the year
- Provides mental comfort for hiring permanent staff
- Father's advice: "Have a war chest -- if there's a hard hit, you must resist and pay people"

### Covid Lesson

When Covid hit, sponsors with physical retail pulled out overnight. Revenue potential halved instantly. But pre-signed annual contracts held firm. Meanwhile, new sponsors emerged (gaming, online services). The buffer from signed contracts prevented panic.

## Creative Independence Rules

1. **Never let sponsors inspire concepts** -- stopped doing this after years of friction
   - Early approach: brand campaign could inspire a video concept. Sometimes produced great ideas.
   - Problem: brand then claimed partial ownership of the concept and dictated execution details
   - Current approach: create concepts independently, then find sponsors that fit

2. **"Who loves us, follows us"** -- refuse creative interference
   - If a brand says "make it 49 instead of 50" -- answer is no, it's 50
   - Sponsors buy access to the audience within the creator's format, not editorial control

3. **Sponsor rotation is natural** -- the "Big Five" evolve over time
   - Classic YouTube sponsors: NordVPN, Revolut, RhinoShield, World of Tanks
   - Market shifts bring new sponsors who are more educated about YouTube content
   - Don't over-depend on any single sponsor

## Sponsor Economics Per Video

Not every video needs to be individually profitable:

- Some videos cost 25-50K EUR to produce (e.g., "50 Sosies")
- Some cost much more with international travel and logistics
- Profitable videos subsidize passion projects (documentaries, experimental concepts)
- Annual view: total sponsor revenue + total AdSense vs total production costs
