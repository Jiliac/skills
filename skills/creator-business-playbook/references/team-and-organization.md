# Team & Organization

## Rule of 3 Scaling Thresholds

Team complexity jumps at predictable multiples of 3:

| Size     | Dynamics                                         | Challenge                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1 (solo) | Full control, full burden                        | Everything is on you                          |
| 3        | First interpersonal conflicts, majority dynamics | Two can disagree with one                     |
| 9-10     | Need dedicated managers                          | Can't manage everyone directly                |
| 30       | Managers of managers, political dynamics emerge  | Founder can finally refocus on core value-add |
| 100+     | Corporate-level complexity                       | Multiple layers of management                 |

### The 0-to-10 Paradox

Between 1 and 10 people, hiring feels like it makes things worse, not better. You need people because you can't do everything, but your day gets harder, not easier. Someone asks to leave early for a fiber technician appointment right before a shoot. You didn't sign up to manage that.

### The 30-Person Inflection

At 30, with managers of managers in place, the founder regains capacity to focus on their core value-add (making content, being creative). The operational burden shifts to middle management. This is the goal for a creator-led business.

## Employment Model

All 30 employees on CDI (permanent contracts -- French equivalent of full-time permanent employment):

- No freelancers for core production crew
- Builds loyalty and institutional knowledge
- Province recruiting argument: "you won't die at the task here"
- When people relocate to Angers for the job, they need stability assurance

### Why Not Freelancers/Intermittents

Province location (Angers) means fewer available intermittents du spectacle compared to Paris. Those available may be less familiar with YouTube/internet production workflows. Permanent staff solves this.

## Work-Life Balance as Recruiting Advantage

Refuse the audiovisual industry norm of insane hours:

- "I want people to have normal schedules"
- Position this as a recruiting argument, especially for talent relocating from Paris
- People stay late when there's a genuine crunch, but it's the exception, not the norm
- This is both a moral stance and a practical business advantage in hiring

## Organization Structure at 30 People

- ~5-10 people on set during shoots (varies by concept)
- ~10 people in post-production
- Remaining staff across management, commercial (Sputnik agency), operations
- Salaried comedians (Thomas, Yvan, Etienne) -- always available, no scheduling friction
- Internal chef decor (set designer) + external construction partners
- President role (dezoomed CEO) focused on strategic decisions + content creation

## Founder's Role Evolution

Early stage: do everything (write, shoot, edit, publish, manage)
Growth stage: manage people, lose creative time
Mature stage (30+): delegate operations, return to core value-add

- "My value-add is making videos, making jokes, and being the entertainer"
- Operational management delegated to layer of managers
- Strategic/financial oversight maintained at board level
