# Diversification

## Core Principle

Stay majority shareholder in all ventures. Diversification provides a financial safety net if content creation stops. Side businesses should be genuinely separate from YouTube -- not just merch with a logo.

## Ventures

### Sputnik (Influencer Marketing Agency)

- Internal agency managing Amixem's own commercial relationships
- Also represents other creators
- Eliminates dependency on external agencies (Webedia, etc.)
- Still collaborates with external agencies when needed
- Not a strategic priority to scale aggressively -- other fronts are more important

### Spacefox (Merch -> Jewelry/Watches)

- Started 2017-2018 as a textile/merch brand
- Differentiation: 100% custom-designed garments manufactured in Turkish workshops (not just logo flocage)
- **Pivot insight**: textile business is fundamentally about logistics, not design. "You must become the best warehouse, not the best designer."
- Pivoted to jewelry: bracelets containing real meteorite fragments (Moon, Mars)
- Current focus: space-themed accessories with genuine scientific materials

### Akrone (Horlogerie)

- Real watchmaking GMT watch
- Collaboration with established watch manufacturer
- Multiple timezone display
- Spacefox design DNA (space aesthetic)
- Created with friends as co-founders, self-funded, no external investors

### Star Smash (Burgers)

- Joint-venture with Taster (dark kitchen operator)
- **Partnership structure**: intentionally locked -- no exit clause forces both parties to find compromises
  - "If we can separate easily, it's too easy to walk away. I prefer 'survive or die together' for some projects."
  - Forces solution-finding over relationship-ending
- Launched in 50 cities simultaneously via Taster's dark kitchen network
- Key concern #1: food hygiene -- "must be clinical, before taste even matters"
- Province advantage: less competition in delivery platforms, but validated by Parisian palates
- Revenue model: delivery platforms (Uber Eats, Deliveroo) + potential future physical restaurants
- Food business lesson: it's a "centimier" business -- you negotiate the price per kilo of tomatoes

### Creative Vision (original inspiration)

- Dream: Pizza Planet from Toy Story aesthetic for a physical restaurant
- 10+ years of ideation before finding the right partner
- Multiple failed conversations with bakeries, franchise operators, other food industry contacts
- Taster cold-emailed at exactly the right moment ("the eagles of Gandalf arrived")

## Entrepreneurial DNA

- Parents were entrepreneurs in electromenager (home appliances/kitchens)
- Survived the 2008 financial crisis (nearly lost everything)
- Father's advice: "Never be an entrepreneur" (ironic) + "Always have a war chest"
- In the 1990s, entrepreneurship without family precedent was nearly unthinkable in France
- The "apple doesn't fall far from the tree" -- grew up seeing the entrepreneur lifestyle firsthand
