# Production & Facilities

## Internalization Strategy

Internalize everything to maintain independence and control:

- **Crew**: all camera operators, sound engineers, directors on permanent contracts
- **Equipment**: own all cameras, lights, sound gear
- **Sets/Decor**: dedicated chef decor (set designer) on staff, external construction partners for builds
- **Talent**: salaried comedians (Thomas, Yvan, Etienne) -- always available, no per-shoot negotiation
- **Post-production**: in-house editing team (~10 people)
- **Commercial**: Sputnik, internal influencer marketing agency

Only external dependencies: specialized set construction labor and guest logistics.

## Province Strategy (Angers)

### Cost Arbitrage

- Monthly facility payment = half-day studio rental cost in Paris
- For ~3M EUR in Angers: 850-900m2 shooting floor + 1,500m2 offices, all purpose-built
- Salary costs slightly lower than Paris (though Amixem tries to align with Parisian salaries)
- Nearby Nantes provides additional cultural industry workforce

### Independence Benefits

- Not dependent on Paris infrastructure, talent pools, or real estate market
- Full control over schedule and facilities
- Protection from celebrity overexposure (provincial anonymity)
- "Cocon" effect: comfortable working environment away from media circus

### Trade-offs

- Harder to attract A-list guests (they must travel to Angers)
- Fewer available intermittents du spectacle
- Less spontaneous networking with other creators
- Must invest more in permanent infrastructure

## New Studio Build (MrBeast-Inspired)

### Trigger

Visit to MrBeast's Greenville, NC facilities revealed value of purpose-built studios. Current studio too small -- cameramen have walls 1 meter behind them. Set construction happens where filming occurs (requires dismantling between shoots).

### Specifications

- Budget: 2-6M EUR (tiered "drawer" approach, starting at 2.3M)
- 850-900m2 effective shooting surface
- 1,500m2 offices
- 6.5m usable ceiling height (building needs 10-12m total for rails, lights, insulation)
- Single large reconfigurable hangar (mount/dismount sets as needed)

### Required Facilities

- **Set construction workshop**: dedicated space to build sets separately from filming area
- **Mega loge**: reception area for 50+ figurants/extras (people traveling from abroad deserve proper welcome)
- **VIP loge**: dedicated space for celebrity guests (Pierre Niney, Kev Adams, etc.)
- **Offices**: may co-locate with studios or keep separate (under discussion)

### Design Philosophy

"An on-demand tool" -- purpose-built to match specific production needs rather than adapting to generic rental spaces. Eliminates the "bascule" (1-1.5h pause to move equipment between spaces).

## Production Cost Benchmarks

| Concept                     | Approximate Cost           | Notes                                                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "50 Sosies" (50 Lookalikes) | 25-50K EUR                 | Fixed set, variable travel costs for international lookalikes |
| Documentary (travel)        | ~50K EUR                   | 2 weeks abroad, 5-person crew                                 |
| Standard studio concept     | Lower (internalized costs) | Hard to isolate from fixed overhead                           |

Note: exact per-video costs are hard to calculate when crew is salaried. The real cost model is annual: total overhead vs total revenue.
