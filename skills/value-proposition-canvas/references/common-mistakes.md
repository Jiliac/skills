# Common Mistakes

Pitfalls when creating and using a Value Proposition Canvas, from Strategyzer and practitioner sources.

## Mistake 1: Starting From Features Instead of Customers

**What happens:** Fill the value map first, then reverse-engineer a customer profile to justify it.

**Why it fails:** Confirmation bias. You'll only "discover" pains your features already solve.

**Fix:** Fill the customer profile first with no reference to your product. Cover the right side of the canvas entirely before touching the left side.

## Mistake 2: Mixing Multiple Segments on One Canvas

**What happens:** "Our customers are health-conscious millennials AND busy parents AND GLP-1 users."

**Why it fails:** Different segments have different jobs, pains, and gains. Mixing them creates a mushy middle that resonates with no one.

**Fix:** One canvas per segment. If you serve three segments, create three canvases. Shared pains across canvases reveal your core value.

## Mistake 3: Listing Feature Absence as a Pain

**What happens:** "Pain: no AI meal suggestions" — this describes your solution's absence, not the customer's reality.

**Why it fails:** Pains must exist independently of any solution. Otherwise you're just writing a feature wishlist.

**Fix:** Reframe as the customer's lived experience: "Doesn't know what to cook and defaults to unhealthy takeout three times a week."

## Mistake 4: Being Vague Instead of Specific

**What happens:** Pain: "tracking is hard." Gain: "easier tracking."

**Why it fails:** No actionable insight. Can't measure. Can't design a feature against it.

**Fix:** Quantify and contextualize: "Logging a meal takes >2 minutes of manual ingredient search, which they do 3x/day." Gain: "Log a meal in under 10 seconds."

## Mistake 5: Treating the Canvas as Static

**What happens:** Fill it once during a brainstorm, never update it.

**Why it fails:** Customer needs evolve. Competitors change. Your product changes. A static canvas becomes decoration.

**Fix:** Review quarterly. Update after every round of customer interviews. Re-map after significant feature launches.

## Mistake 6: No Prioritization

**What happens:** List 15 pains, 12 gains, 20 features. Everything is equally important.

**Why it fails:** You can't address everything. Without ranking, you'll spread thin and address nothing well.

**Fix:** Force-rank. Pick the top 3 pains and top 3 gains. Your MVP addresses only those. Everything else waits for validation.

## Mistake 7: Skipping Validation

**What happens:** Canvas looks great on paper. Ship the product. Nobody uses it.

**Why it fails:** The canvas captures your assumptions, not reality. Without testing, assumptions stay untested.

**Fix:** Every item on the canvas is a hypothesis. Design experiments: interviews for jobs/pains/gains, landing page tests for the statement, retention metrics for relievers/creators.

## Mistake 8: Generic Value Proposition Statement

**What happens:** "For people who want to be healthier, [App] is a nutrition app that helps them eat better."

**Why it fails:** Could describe any of 500 nutrition apps. No differentiation. No specificity. Won't convert.

**Fix:** Be ruthlessly specific about segment, pain, mechanism, and alternative:

> "For French health-conscious professionals who abandon calorie trackers after a week, [App] is a nutrition agent that remembers your habits and tells you what to eat next, unlike MyFitnessPal which treats every meal as a blank slate."

## Mistake 9: Ignoring Context Beyond the Product

**What happens:** Canvas only maps product features, ignoring pricing, branding, distribution, and switching costs.

**Why it fails:** Value proposition includes the full experience: how you buy it, what it costs, how it makes you feel, how easy it is to switch.

**Fix:** Include supporting jobs (buyer, transferrer) in the customer profile. Consider non-product pain relievers: free trial (reduces risk), data export (reduces lock-in fear), social proof (reduces uncertainty).

## Mistake 10: Fabricating Customers Instead of Discovering Them

**What happens:** Build the customer profile from imagination in a conference room.

**Why it fails:** Your mental model of the customer is always incomplete and biased. "We think they want X" is not evidence.

**Fix:** Base every item on evidence: interview quotes, support tickets, competitor reviews, usage data, survey results. Mark assumed items clearly and prioritize validating them.

## Quick Checklist

Before considering a canvas complete:

- [ ] Customer profile filled first, without reference to your product
- [ ] One segment per canvas
- [ ] No "lacks feature X" pains
- [ ] All pains/gains are specific and measurable
- [ ] Items are ranked by severity/importance
- [ ] Every feature connects to at least one pain or gain
- [ ] Unconnected features flagged for removal
- [ ] Unaddressed top pains/gains flagged as gaps
- [ ] Value prop statement is specific enough to differentiate
- [ ] Key assumptions identified for validation
