# Value Map (Left Side)

Your offering, described in terms of how it connects to the customer profile.

## Products & Services

The actual things you offer. List them concretely.

### Types

- **Physical/tangible**: Hardware, printed materials, in-person services
- **Digital**: Apps, platforms, APIs, online courses
- **Intangible**: Consulting, coaching, guarantees, community access
- **Financial**: Subscriptions, insurance, financing options

### What to List

List features at the level where they map to specific jobs/pains/gains:

- Too vague: "AI-powered app"
- Right level: "Photo-based meal logging", "Weekly nutrition digest", "Personalized meal suggestions"

### Relevance Ranking

Not all products/services matter equally. Rank by how central each is to your value proposition:

- **Essential**: Core to the value proposition, customers buy for this
- **Supporting**: Enhances the core but isn't the reason to buy
- **Nice-to-have**: Differentiator but not critical

## Pain Relievers

How your products and services specifically alleviate customer pains.

### Mapping Pattern

| Customer Pain                            | Pain Reliever                                  | Enabling Feature                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "Logging every meal takes too long"      | Auto-fills 80% of meals from photo + history   | Photo recognition + meal memory       |
| "I quit every tracking app after a week" | Proactive nudges with near-zero input required | Push notifications + passive tracking |
| "App doesn't understand French food"     | French food database + cultural meal patterns  | Localized food model                  |

### Quality Checks

For each pain reliever, verify:

- Does it address a **real pain** from the customer profile (not a made-up one)?
- Is the mechanism specific? ("saves time" is vague; "reduces logging from 2 min to 5 sec per meal" is specific)
- Can you measure whether it actually relieves the pain?

### What Pain Relievers Can Do

- Produce savings (time, money, effort)
- Make customers feel better (reduce frustration, annoyance, headaches)
- Fix underperforming solutions
- Put an end to difficulties and challenges
- Wipe out negative social consequences
- Eliminate or reduce risks
- Help customers sleep better at night (address big concerns)
- Limit or eradicate common mistakes
- Remove barriers to adoption

## Gain Creators

How your products and services create customer gains.

### Mapping Pattern

| Customer Gain                               | Gain Creator                                         | Enabling Feature                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| "Know if I'm eating well without obsessing" | Weekly digest with pattern insights                  | Analytics + notification system |
| "Get told what to eat, not just what I ate" | Contextual meal suggestions based on history + goals | Recommendation engine           |
| "Feel in control without effort"            | Automatic tracking that works in background          | Passive data collection         |

### Quality Checks

For each gain creator, verify:

- Does it connect to a **specific gain** from the customer profile?
- Is the outcome measurable or observable?
- Does it create a gain the customer actually ranked highly?

### What Gain Creators Can Do

- Create savings that matter to customers
- Produce outcomes customers expect or exceed expectations
- Copy or outperform existing solutions that delight customers
- Make the customer's job or life easier
- Create positive social consequences
- Do something specific that customers are looking for
