# Customer Profile (Right Side)

The customer's world, described independently of your solution.

## Customer Jobs

What the customer is trying to get done. Three types:

### Functional Jobs

Practical tasks and problems to solve.

- "Track what I eat during the day"
- "Find a recipe with ingredients I have"
- "File my tax return"

### Social Jobs

How the customer wants to be perceived by others.

- "Look knowledgeable about wine at dinner"
- "Be seen as a responsible parent"
- "Impress my manager with clean reports"

### Emotional Jobs

Specific feelings the customer seeks or avoids.

- "Feel in control of my health"
- "Avoid anxiety about money"
- "Feel creative and inspired"

### Supporting Jobs

Jobs that arise in the context of purchasing or using a solution:

- **Buyer jobs**: comparing, deciding, purchasing ("find the best price")
- **Co-creator jobs**: participating in value creation ("customize my dashboard")
- **Transferrer jobs**: end-of-lifecycle ("cancel and export my data")

### Trigger Questions for Jobs

- What tasks are they trying to perform at work? In life?
- What problems are they trying to solve?
- What needs are they trying to satisfy?
- What would they like to achieve?
- What role do they want to fill?
- In what context do they perform these jobs? (time, place, with whom)

## Customer Pains

Anything that annoys, frustrates, or prevents the customer from getting jobs done.

### Categories

**Undesired outcomes**: Things that go wrong.

- "I logged everything but the calorie count was wrong"
- "The report took 3 hours and my boss still asked for changes"

**Obstacles**: Things that prevent starting or finishing a job.

- "I don't know what half these ingredients are"
- "The app doesn't work offline"

**Risks**: Potential negative consequences.

- "If I pick the wrong tool, I'll waste a month migrating"
- "My data could be exposed"

### Severity Levels

Rank each pain:

- **Extreme**: Blocks the job entirely or causes significant harm
- **High**: Creates major friction, customer actively seeks solutions
- **Moderate**: Annoying but tolerable
- **Low**: Minor inconvenience, rarely top-of-mind

### Pain Anti-Pattern

"Doesn't have feature X" is **not** a customer pain. Pains exist before and without your product:

- Bad: "Doesn't have AI meal suggestions"
- Good: "Never knows what to cook and defaults to takeout"

### Trigger Questions for Pains

- What do they find too costly? (time, money, effort)
- What makes them feel bad?
- What current solutions underperform for them?
- What are the main difficulties and challenges they encounter?
- What negative social consequences do they face or fear?
- What risks do they fear? (financial, social, technical)
- What common mistakes do they make?
- What barriers keep them from adopting a solution?

## Customer Gains

Benefits and outcomes the customer wants. Not just the absence of pains.

### Categories

**Required gains**: Minimum expectations without which a solution doesn't work.

- "The app must track calories, not just food names"

**Expected gains**: What customers take for granted.

- "The app should be available on my phone"

**Desired gains**: Beyond expectations but explicitly wanted.

- "I wish it would suggest meals based on my fridge contents"

**Unexpected gains**: Beyond imagination, creates delight.

- "It noticed I always eat badly on Thursdays and suggested why"

### Trigger Questions for Gains

- What savings (time, money, effort) would make them happy?
- What quality levels do they expect?
- What would make their job or life easier?
- What positive social consequences do they desire?
- What are they looking for most? (good design, specific features, guarantees)
- What would increase their likelihood of adopting a solution?
- What do they dream about? What would be a big relief?

## Prioritization

After listing jobs, pains, and gains, rank them:

| Dimension | Ranking Question                                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jobs      | How important is this job? (critical vs. trivial)        |
| Jobs      | How frequently does this job occur? (daily vs. yearly)   |
| Pains     | How severe is this pain? (extreme vs. minor)             |
| Gains     | How essential is this gain? (must-have vs. nice-to-have) |

Focus your value map on the top-ranked items. Addressing a moderate pain brilliantly matters less than addressing an extreme pain adequately.
