# Fit and Validation

The canvas is a hypothesis, not a fact. Three levels of fit to achieve progressively.

## Three Levels of Fit

### 1. Problem-Solution Fit (on paper)

Evidence that customers have the jobs, pains, and gains you identified, and that your value proposition addresses them.

**How to test:**

- Customer interviews: "Tell me about the last time you tried to [job]"
- Survey validation: rank pains/gains, see if your prioritization matches
- Competitor reviews mining: what do people complain about in alternatives?

**You have it when:** Customers confirm "yes, that's exactly my problem" and your proposed relief matches their language.

### 2. Product-Market Fit (in market)

Evidence that your product actually creates and delivers value in the real world.

**How to test:**

- Landing page / smoke test: does the value proposition statement convert?
- MVP usage: do people use the features mapped as pain relievers?
- Retention: do users come back? (strongest signal)
- Sean Ellis test: >40% of users say they'd be "very disappointed" without your product

**You have it when:** Organic growth, high retention, users describing your product the way your value prop statement reads.

### 3. Business Model Fit (at scale)

Evidence that you can deliver the value proposition in a scalable, profitable way.

**How to test:**

- Unit economics: CAC < LTV?
- Can you serve the segment profitably?
- Does the delivery model scale?

**You have it when:** Sustainable growth with positive unit economics.

## Validation Methods

### Customer Interviews

Best source for validating the customer profile side.

**Structure:**

1. Ask about their world, not your solution
2. "Tell me about the last time you [job]..."
3. "What was the hardest part?"
4. "How did you work around that?"
5. "What would the ideal outcome look like?"

**Red flags:**

- "Yeah, that sounds cool" = politeness, not validation
- Only hypothetical enthusiasm counts as weak signal
- Past behavior > stated preferences

### Landing Page Tests

Best for validating the value proposition statement.

**Method:**

1. Write the statement from Step 5 of the canvas
2. Create a minimal landing page with that headline + CTA
3. Drive traffic (ads, social, communities)
4. Measure: click-through, sign-up, waitlist conversion

**What to vary:**

- Test different value prop statements from different pains/gains emphases
- Test segment-specific messaging (one page per canvas)

### A/B Testing Feature Impact

Best for validating pain relievers and gain creators post-launch.

**Method:**

- Toggle features on/off for cohorts
- Measure impact on retention, engagement, satisfaction
- If a "pain reliever" feature has zero impact on churn, re-examine the mapping

## Iteration Patterns

### Pivot the Segment

Same product, different customer. Redraw the customer profile for a new segment and check fit.

### Pivot the Value Map

Same customer, different approach. Keep the customer profile, redesign how you address top pains/gains.

### Narrow the Focus

Too many pains addressed weakly. Cut features, double down on the 2-3 pains that matter most.

### Expand After Fit

Only after achieving fit on the core pains/gains, extend to secondary ones.

## When to Re-Do the Canvas

- Customer interviews consistently reveal jobs/pains you didn't list
- Your top features don't correlate with retention
- Competitive landscape shifts (new entrant addresses pains you don't)
- You pivot to a new segment
- Quarterly review as a living document
