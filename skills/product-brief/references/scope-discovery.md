# MVP Scope Discovery

Facilitate scope definition that balances ambition with realism. Prevent scope
creep by establishing clear boundaries.

## 1. Core MVP Features

Open with:
> Now let's define what we need to build first.
> - What's the absolute minimum to solve the core problem?
> - What features would make users say "this solves my problem"?
> - What's the smallest version that creates real value?

**MVP criteria — each feature must pass:**
- **Solves Core Problem:** Addresses the main pain point
- **User Value:** Creates meaningful outcome for target users
- **Feasible:** Achievable with available resources
- **Testable:** Allows learning and iteration from user feedback

**Elicitation questions:**
- What's the core functionality that must work?
- Which features directly address the main problem?
- What would users consider "incomplete" if missing?
- What creates the "aha!" moment we discussed earlier?

## 2. Out of Scope

Explicitly define what won't be in the MVP:
- What features are nice-to-have but not essential?
- What could wait for version 2.0?
- What are we intentionally saying "no" to for now?

Provide rationale for each deferral.

## 3. MVP Success Criteria

- How will we know the MVP is successful?
- What metrics indicate we should proceed beyond MVP?
- What user feedback signals validate our approach?
- What's the decision point for scaling beyond MVP?

## 4. Future Vision

- If wildly successful, what does it become in 2-3 years?
- What capabilities would we add with more resources?
- How does the MVP evolve into the full product vision?
- What markets or user segments could we expand to?
