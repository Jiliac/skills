# Success Metrics Discovery

Facilitate definition of measurable success criteria. Connect user value to
business outcomes.

## 1. User Success Metrics

Open with:
> Now that we know who this serves and what problem it solves, let's define
> what success looks like.
> - How will we know we're succeeding for our users?
> - What would make users say "this was worth it"?
> - What metrics show we're creating real value?

**Push vague to specific:**
- "Users are happy" -> "Users complete [key action] within [timeframe]"
- "Product is useful" -> "Users return [frequency] and use [core feature]"
- Focus on outcomes and behaviors, not satisfaction scores

**Elicitation questions:**
- What outcome are users trying to achieve?
- How will they know the product is working for them?
- What behaviors indicate users are getting value?

## 2. Business Objectives

- What does success look like at 3 months? 12 months?
- Are we measuring revenue, user growth, engagement, something else?
- How does this product contribute to broader company goals?

**Categories to explore:**
- **Growth:** User acquisition, market penetration
- **Engagement:** Usage patterns, retention, satisfaction
- **Financial:** Revenue, profitability, cost efficiency
- **Strategic:** Market position, competitive advantage

## 3. Key Performance Indicators

Transform objectives into measurable KPIs:
- Ensure each KPI has a clear measurement method
- Define targets and timeframes where appropriate
- Include leading indicators that predict success

**Validate alignment:**
- Does each metric connect back to the product vision?
- Do user success metrics drive business success?
- Are we measuring what truly matters vs. vanity metrics?
