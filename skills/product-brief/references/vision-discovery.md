# Vision & Problem Discovery

Facilitate a conversation that moves from problem understanding to solution vision.
Follow this sequence — don't jump to solutions before the problem is clear.

## 1. Problem Space

Open with:
> Tell me about the product you envision:
> - What core problem are you trying to solve?
> - Who experiences this problem most acutely?
> - What would success look like for the people you're helping?

Then dig deeper:
- How do people currently solve this problem?
- What's frustrating about current solutions?
- What happens if this problem goes unsolved?
- Who feels this pain most intensely?

**Push for specificity.** Don't accept "it's inefficient" — ask what specifically
is inefficient, how much time/money it costs, what the emotional impact is.

## 2. Current Solutions Analysis

- What solutions exist today?
- Where do they fall short?
- What gaps are they leaving open?
- Why haven't existing solutions solved this completely?

## 3. Solution Vision

- If we could solve this perfectly, what would that look like?
- What's the simplest way to make a meaningful difference?
- What makes this approach different from what's out there?
- What would make users say "this is exactly what I needed"?

## 4. Unique Differentiators

- What's the unfair advantage?
- What would be hard for competitors to copy?
- What insight or approach is uniquely theirs?
- Why is now the right time for this solution?
