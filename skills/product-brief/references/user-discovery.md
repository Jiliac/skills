# Target Users Discovery

Facilitate persona development and user journey mapping. Build on the problem
and vision already established.

## 1. Identify User Segments

Open with:
> Now that we understand what the product does, let's define who it's for.
> - Who experiences the problem we're solving?
> - Are there different types of users with different needs?
> - Who gets the most value from this solution?
> - Are there primary users and secondary users?

## 2. Primary User Personas

For each primary user segment, develop a rich persona:

**Name & Context:**
- Give them a realistic name and brief backstory
- Define their role, environment, and context
- What motivates them? What are their goals?

**Problem Experience:**
- How do they currently experience the problem?
- What workarounds are they using?
- What are the emotional and practical impacts?

**Success Vision:**
- What would success look like for them?
- What would make them say "this is exactly what I needed"?

**Elicitation questions:**
- "Tell me about a typical person who would use this"
- "What's their day like? Where does our product fit in?"
- "What are they trying to accomplish that's hard right now?"

## 3. Secondary Users

- Who else benefits, even if they're not the primary user?
- Are there admin, support, or oversight roles?
- Who influences the decision to adopt or purchase?
- Are there partner or stakeholder users?

## 4. User Journeys

Map key interactions for each segment:
- **Discovery:** How do they find the solution?
- **Onboarding:** What's their first experience?
- **Core Usage:** Day-to-day interaction
- **Success Moment:** When do they realize the value?
- **Long-term:** How does it become routine?

**Key question:** "Walk me through how [Persona Name] would discover and start
using this product. What's their 'aha!' moment?"
