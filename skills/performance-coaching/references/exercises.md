## Implementation Intentions

The most evidence-backed technique for closing the knowing-doing gap (d = 0.65 across 642 tests).

**Format:** "If [specific situation/time], then I will [specific action]."

**Rules:**

- The "if" must be a concrete, observable trigger — not a feeling. "If it is 9 AM" not "if I feel motivated."
- The "then" must be a single, specific, physical action. "Open CRM and click compose" not "do outreach."
- Rehearse the if-then link at least once mentally. Visualize the trigger, then see yourself doing the action.
- Write it down. Keep it visible.

**Examples for sales/distribution avoidance:**

- "If it is Tuesday 9 AM and I have my coffee, then I will open my prospect list and draft the first email."
- "If I finish a deep work block and it is before noon, then I will spend 15 minutes on LinkedIn before switching tasks."
- "If I feel the urge to start a new project, then I will first complete today's outreach commitment."
- "If someone asks what I do, then I will say 'I build AI tools for businesses' and ask about their challenges."

## WOOP / Mental Contrasting

Wish-Outcome-Obstacle-Plan. The ordering is critical — reversing it eliminates the effect.

**Step 1 — Wish:** "What's your most important goal this week?" (One sentence)

**Step 2 — Outcome:** "Imagine you achieved it. What's the best possible outcome? How would it feel? Picture it vividly." (30 seconds of genuine visualization)

**Step 3 — Obstacle:** "Now — what's the main internal obstacle? Not external circumstances. What inside you gets in the way?" (The shift from positive to obstacle creates the motivational tension)

**Step 4 — Plan:** "If [obstacle appears], then I will [specific response]." (Implementation intention targeting the internal obstacle)

**Example:**

- Wish: Land a new consulting client this month
- Outcome: Meeting a prospect, feeling confident, hearing "yes," the relief and momentum
- Obstacle: The voice that says "I'll do outreach tomorrow" — the avoidance kick
- Plan: "If I notice the 'tomorrow' thought, then I will immediately open my email and write one subject line."

## Graduated Exposure Hierarchy

Systematic desensitization to sales/visibility/distribution discomfort. Rate each level using SUDS (Subjective Units of Distress, 0-100).

### Default Hierarchy (Adapt to Current Situation)

| Level | SUDS  | Action                                               |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | 10-20 | Research 20 potential outreach targets               |
| 2     | 20-30 | Draft a cold email/DM without sending                |
| 3     | 30-40 | Send one email to a low-stakes contact               |
| 4     | 40-50 | Post a professional insight on LinkedIn              |
| 5     | 50-60 | Send 5 cold outreach messages in one session         |
| 6     | 60-70 | Make a direct pitch to a warm contact                |
| 7     | 70-80 | Cold call a potential client by phone                |
| 8     | 80-90 | Pitch at a networking event or on live video         |
| 9     | 90+   | Ask for a major commitment (large contract, keynote) |

### Protocol

- Start at the level where SUDS = 30-40 (uncomfortable but not overwhelming)
- Stay at each level until SUDS drops below 30 for that action
- Move up one level at a time
- If a level feels impossible, break it into sub-steps
- Pair with behavioral experiments: predict the worst outcome, do the action, record what actually happened

### Recalibrating

After each month, re-rate the hierarchy. Levels that were 60+ should be trending downward. If not, something is blocking — consider self-exploration skill or hierarchy redesign.

## Behavioral Experiments

The core engine of change. Predictions meet reality.

**Template for each experiment:**

| Field                   | Entry                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Action                  | [What I'll do — specific]                          |
| When                    | [Date, time]                                       |
| Prediction              | [What I fear will happen + belief strength 0-100%] |
| Actual outcome          | [What actually happened — fill in after]           |
| Updated belief strength | [Same belief, new strength 0-100%]                 |
| What I learned          | [One sentence]                                     |

**Example:**

- Action: Send 5 cold emails to AI consulting prospects
- When: Wednesday 10 AM
- Prediction: All will ignore me, one might respond angrily. I'll feel humiliated. (Belief: 75%)
- Actual: 3 no response, 1 polite decline, 1 asked for a call. No anger. Mild discomfort, not humiliation.
- Updated belief: 20%
- Learned: The catastrophe doesn't happen. Silence is the worst case, not hostility.

## Immunity to Change (Kegan & Lahey) — 4-Column Exercise

Use when the same avoidance keeps recurring despite understanding and good intentions.

| Column 1             | Column 2                                       | Column 3                                                            | Column 4                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Commitment           | What I do/don't do instead                     | Hidden competing commitment                                         | Big assumption                                                 |
| "I want to do sales" | Avoid calls, delay emails, overthink messaging | "I'm committed to being seen as an intellectual, not a salesperson" | "If I sell actively, people will see me as less serious/smart" |

**How to use:**

1. Column 1: State the genuine goal
2. Column 2: List everything you actually do that works against it (be brutally honest)
3. Column 3: Imagine doing the _opposite_ of Column 2 behaviors. What feels scary/wrong? That fear reveals the hidden competing commitment.
4. Column 4: What must you believe for the competing commitment to make sense? That's the big assumption.
5. Design a small, safe test of the big assumption. "I'll pitch directly to one person and observe: do they actually think less of me?"

## Solution-Focused Techniques

### Exception-Finding

"When did the avoidance NOT happen? Tell me about a time you did the scary thing. What was different?" — Builds on existing competence rather than analyzing deficits.

### Scaling Questions

"On 1-10, where are you with [specific behavior]? What would one number higher look like? What's one small thing that would move you up?" — Creates incremental, achievable steps.

### The Miracle Question (Adapted)

"Imagine you wake up tomorrow and your avoidance of sales is gone. You just... do it. What's the first thing that's different about your morning?" — Bypasses analysis of the problem and goes straight to envisioning the solution.

## Novelty Management for the Boring Middle

For the novelty-seeking brain that loses energy on familiar tasks:

- **Rotate the "how," keep the "what" fixed.** Do outreach, but vary the channel (email, LinkedIn, Twitter DM, voice note, video message). Same goal, fresh execution.
- **Time-box with countdown timers.** Urgency activates the interest-based nervous system. 25-minute Pomodoro sprints with visible countdowns.
- **Variable rewards.** Pre-set a menu of small rewards. After completing a work block, randomly select one (roll a die, draw a card). Variable ratio reinforcement maintains motivation better than fixed rewards.
- **Track streaks visually.** A visible chain of completed days leverages loss aversion. Track consistency percentage (not just unbroken chains) — missing one day doesn't reset progress.
- **Break the middle into visible milestones.** The goal gradient effect means motivation increases near completion. Create sub-goals with their own "finish lines."

## Environmental Design / Friction Engineering

People with high self-control don't rely on willpower — they design environments where desired behavior is the default.

- **Reduce friction for desired actions:** CRM tab permanently open, prospect list pre-loaded, email templates pre-drafted, phone on desk during outreach blocks.
- **Increase friction for avoidance actions:** Block gaming sites during work hours, phone in another room during deep work, close Slack/Discord before outreach blocks.
- **Pre-decide:** Decide the night before exactly what you'll do and when. Morning decisions invite avoidance.
- **Create "forcing functions":** Schedule a meeting that requires preparation. Announce a deadline publicly. Book a conference talk before the slides exist.
