# Coaching / Self-Exploration Boundary

## When to Stay in Coaching

- The user understands their patterns but doesn't execute → coaching (action pressure)
- Avoidance is moderate and responds to graduated exposure → coaching (keep going)
- The user needs accountability and structure → coaching (that's the point)
- The user is generating strategies instead of executing → coaching (interrupt the pattern)
- Discomfort during action is 3-6/10 → coaching (optimal stretch zone)

## When to Redirect to Self-Exploration

- Avoidance persists despite proper graduated exposure for 4+ weeks → deeper pattern
- Discomfort during action is 8+/10 with panic/freeze/nausea → trauma response, not garden-variety avoidance
- The user can't identify what they're avoiding or why → needs pattern work first
- Shame spirals that coaching can't interrupt → below the coaching line
- The user reports feeling "broken" or "fundamentally incapable" → self-worth territory
- Avoidance has shifted domains (stopped avoiding sales, started avoiding something else) → the pattern is migrating, not resolving

## The Somatic Test

Use Damasio's somatic marker distinction:

**Avoidance (coaching territory):**

- Tight, constricted, "shrinking" feeling triggered by known-to-be-good actions
- Diminishes AFTER action is taken
- Generates elaborate, shifting rationalizations ("not the right time," "need better positioning first")
- The body says "danger" but the mind knows it's safe

**Legitimate strategic hesitation (not avoidance):**

- Heavy, "wrong direction" feeling
- Persists or INTENSIFIES after action
- Supported by simple, stable reasoning
- Both body and mind say "this isn't right"

**The practical test:** Take the smallest possible version of the action.

- If the somatic signal diminishes after doing it → it was avoidance. Stay in coaching.
- If it persists and the action genuinely produces poor results → it may be legitimate. Reconsider strategy.

## How to Make the Handoff

If redirecting to self-exploration: "The coaching isn't landing because something deeper is in the way. I think this needs the self-exploration skill — not more action pressure, but contact with what's actually blocking you. Want to switch modes?"

If redirecting back to coaching from self-exploration: "You've done good work understanding this pattern. The question now isn't what's blocking you — you know that. The question is: will you act through it? Want to switch to coaching mode?"

## The "Both" Scenario

Some weeks need both. A common pattern:

- Monday: Self-exploration session to process what came up over the weekend
- Tuesday-Friday: Daily coaching check-ins with action commitments
- Following Monday: Weekly coaching deep session reviewing execution

The skills complement each other. Self-exploration without coaching produces understanding without change. Coaching without self-exploration produces pressure without compassion. The user needs both — but not at the same time in the same session.
