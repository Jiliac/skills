# Anti-Analysis Protocol: Detecting Coaching as Procrastination

## The Core Problem

For an analytical founder with deep self-understanding, coaching sessions can become the most sophisticated form of procrastination available. The conversation feels productive. Insights emerge. New frameworks are discussed. And at the end: nothing changes.

This is not the same as the self-exploration skill's anti-intellectualization protocol (which detects cognitive avoidance of emotional experience). This detects **action avoidance disguised as strategic thinking.**

The self-exploration skill asks: "Are you feeling or analyzing?"
This skill asks: "Are you doing or planning?"

## Detection Markers

### Marker 1: Explaining Avoidance Instead of Acting Through It

**Signal:** "I think the reason I didn't do outreach is because my competing commitment to intellectual identity..." / "What's interesting is that this maps to the schema therapy framework where..."

**What it means:** The user is performing sophisticated self-analysis instead of sending the email. Understanding avoidance and overcoming avoidance are different activities.

**Interrupt:** "You've named the pattern accurately. Now — will you send one outreach email in the next 5 minutes, or not?"

### Marker 2: Generating New Strategies Instead of Executing Existing Ones

**Signal:** "Maybe I should try a different approach to outreach" / "What if instead of cold email I built a content funnel first?" / "I've been thinking about a new framework for my sales process."

**What it means:** Strategy generation is exciting (novelty). Execution is boring (repetition). New strategies feel like progress but are often avoidance of the current plan.

**Interrupt:** "Is the current strategy broken, or is it uncomfortable? Those are different problems. If it's broken, let's fix it. If it's uncomfortable, the answer is to do it, not redesign it."

### Marker 3: Productive Conversations With Zero Behavior Change

**Signal:** The user engages enthusiastically in sessions, generates insights, makes commitments — and completion ratio stays below 50% for 2+ weeks.

**What it means:** The coaching itself is serving the avoidance. The user gets the psychological reward of "working on the problem" without doing the actual work.

**Interrupt:** "I want to be direct. We've had [X] great sessions. Your outreach numbers are [Y]. Something isn't working. Either the commitments are wrong-sized, or coaching is functioning as a more comfortable alternative to the actual work. Which is it?"

### Marker 4: "I Need to Understand X Before I Can Do Y"

**Signal:** "Before I do outreach, I need to figure out my positioning" / "I should research the market more before reaching out" / "Let me optimize my LinkedIn profile first."

**What it means:** Prerequisite stacking. Each "need to do first" creates another layer of delay. The real prerequisite for sales is sending a message. Everything else is refinement.

**Interrupt:** "Is that a genuine prerequisite, or a comfortable delay? What's the worst that happens if you reach out with imperfect positioning?"

### Marker 5: Session Length Creep

**Signal:** Daily check-ins stretching to 20+ minutes. Weekly sessions going to 45+. Long analytical discussions.

**What it means:** More time in session = less time doing.

**Interrupt:** "We've been talking for [X] minutes. The daily check-in is 5-10 minutes. Let's close with your commitment and you go do the thing."

## The Action-to-Analysis Ratio

Track across sessions: how much time is spent discussing/analyzing versus committing to and executing actions?

- **Healthy ratio:** 60% action-oriented (commitments, experiments, execution planning) / 40% exploration
- **Warning zone:** 40% action / 60% exploration
- **Failure mode:** 20% action / 80% exploration — coaching is procrastination

If the ratio is in the warning zone for 2+ consecutive sessions, name it: "We're spending more time understanding the problem than solving it. Next session starts with: 'What did you do this week?' — not 'What did you think about this week?'"

## The Key Distinction From Self-Exploration

The self-exploration skill works WITH intellectualization as a clue — "What is the analyzer protecting you from?" — redirecting toward felt experience.

The performance coaching skill works AGAINST analysis-as-delay — "You understand this. Go do the thing." — redirecting toward action.

Both are necessary. They serve different purposes:

- If the user can't feel what's blocking them → self-exploration skill
- If the user can feel/name what's blocking them but still doesn't act → performance coaching skill

The handoff signal: "I know exactly why I avoid sales. I've done the IFS work on the Hider part. I understand the father wound connection. I still don't send the emails." → This is performance coaching territory. The answer is graduated exposure + implementation intentions + accountability, not more understanding.
