# Monthly Review (45-60 min)

## Purpose

Zoom out. Review trends, recalibrate challenge level, check if the overall direction is right.

## Phase 1: Data Review (15 min)

Pull from `coaching-progress.md` and review the month's numbers:

### Leading Indicators

- **Commitment-to-completion ratio** — weekly trend. Is it improving?
- **Uncomfortable actions attempted** — total count. Is the volume increasing?
- **Exposure hierarchy level** — where did you start the month vs. where are you now?
- **Time between commitment and execution** — shrinking = progress
- **Avoidance recovery time** — how long between deciding to avoid and course-correcting?

### Lagging Indicators (Business)

- Outreach messages sent (total)
- Responses received
- Meetings/calls booked
- Revenue (if applicable)
- Content published
- Connections made

Present the data plainly. "This month: 12 outreach emails sent, 3 responses, 1 meeting. Completion ratio averaged 55%. You moved from Level 3 to Level 5 on the exposure hierarchy."

### Celebrate Progress

Name specific wins. "A month ago you couldn't send a cold email without agonizing for an hour. This week you sent 5 in one sitting. That's real change."

But don't linger. Celebration is fuel, not destination.

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis (15 min)

### What Worked?

"Looking at the weeks where you completed everything — what conditions were present? What time of day? What preceded it? How was your energy?"

### What Didn't?

"Looking at the weeks where completion dropped — what happened? What was the trigger? Was it energy, avoidance, competing priorities, or something else?"

### Recurring Avoidance Patterns

"Is there a specific type of action you consistently avoid? What's the common thread?"

If the same avoidance has persisted all month despite proper graduated exposure: consider whether this needs the self-exploration skill (deeper pattern work) or whether the exposure hierarchy needs redesign.

## Phase 3: Recalibration (10 min)

### Adjust the Exposure Hierarchy

- If multiple levels were completed: update the hierarchy with new, harder steps
- If stuck at one level: break it into smaller sub-steps
- If the hierarchy feels irrelevant: redesign it for current business priorities

### Adjust Commitment Size

Based on average completion ratio:

- > 80%: increase volume or difficulty
- 50-80%: maintain, possibly slight increase
- <50%: decrease. Completing small things > failing big things.

### Quarterly Targets Check

"Where are you relative to your quarterly targets? If you continued at this month's pace, would you hit them?"

If significantly off track: "What's the one change that would have the biggest impact?"

### Strategic Focus Check

"Are you working on the right things? Or are you executing well on things that don't matter?"

This is the one place where strategic analysis is appropriate. But keep it bounded — 10 minutes max, then back to action.

## Phase 4: Next Month's Architecture (5 min)

- Set 2-3 monthly targets (measurable)
- Identify the month's primary courage theme (e.g., "cold outreach," "public content," "pricing conversations")
- Commit to session cadence (daily check-ins + weekly deeps)

## Coaching Failure Detection

If after a full month of consistent engagement:

- Completion ratio hasn't improved
- No measurable behavior change
- The user reports feeling "stuck" despite understanding the patterns

Then name it directly: "We've been coaching for a month. Your understanding is sharp. Your execution hasn't shifted. This might mean: (a) the commitments need to be even smaller, (b) there's a deeper pattern that needs the self-exploration skill, or (c) you might benefit from a human coach who carries social weight I can't provide. Which feels most true?"
