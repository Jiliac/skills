# Weekly Deep Session (30 min)

## Session Arc

Four phases. Stay on time — the tendency to over-explore Phase 2 at the expense of Phase 3 (action planning) is itself avoidance.

---

## Phase 1: Accountability Review (5 min)

Review the week's commitments from `coaching-progress.md`.

**For each commitment:**

- Completed: "What happened? What did you learn? How uncomfortable was it (1-10)?"
- Missed: "What got in the way?" (2 sentences max, then move on)

**Calculate completion ratio.** State it plainly: "You completed 3 of 5 commitments this week. That's 60%."

**Name patterns in what was completed vs. avoided.** "You completed all the technical tasks and avoided all the outreach tasks. What do you notice about that?"

Do NOT let this phase become a therapy session about why things were missed. Acknowledge, note the pattern, move forward.

---

## Phase 2: State Check and Core Exploration (15 min)

### Above-the-Line Check

"Are you showing up today open and curious, or defensive and closed?"

- If defensive/closed: brief shift exercise. Box breathing (4-4-4-4) for 1 minute. Then proceed.
- If open: go directly to exploration.

### Explore What Got in the Way

Pick the most important missed commitment or the biggest avoidance pattern from the week.

**Solution-Focused questions (use these, not "why" questions):**

- "When this week did the avoidance NOT happen? What was different about those times?"
- "What would it look like if this problem were 10% better next week?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you can do [specific action] this week? What would move that number up by 1?"

**Immunity to Change check** (use when the same avoidance keeps recurring):

- "You say you want to do outreach. You don't do outreach. What might you be committed to that's _competing_ with outreach?"
- Common hidden commitments: being seen as intellectual not "salesy," avoiding rejection, maintaining the identity of the builder not the seller, keeping options open by not committing.
- Once identified: "That's the real opponent. Not laziness. A competing commitment. Now — can you hold both? Can you be someone who values intellectual depth AND does sales?"

### Intellectualization Detection

Watch for the session turning into analysis. Markers:

- The user starts explaining their patterns using psychological frameworks
- The conversation feels "productive" but no concrete action is emerging
- The user agrees with observations too quickly ("Yeah, I know, my avoidance pattern...")

Interrupt: "You've described this clearly. Now: what will you do about it this week that you haven't done before?"

## Phase 3: Action Planning (8 min)

### Set 1-3 Commitments for Next Week

For each commitment, specify:

- **Exact time**: "Tuesday at 9 AM"
- **Exact action**: "Send 5 personalized cold emails to [target list]"
- **Exact metric**: "5 emails sent, each with personalized first line"
- **Implementation intention**: "If it is Tuesday 9 AM and I have opened my laptop, then I will open the prospect spreadsheet and write the first email before doing anything else."

### Pre-Plan Obstacle Response

"When you feel resistance, what will you do?"

- "When I feel the urge to check Slack instead, I will close Slack and set a 25-minute timer."
- "When the inner critic says 'this email is bad,' I will send it anyway and improve the next one."

### Identify One Courage Action

Something at or slightly above current comfort threshold on the exposure hierarchy.

**Challenge calibration:**

- If last week's completion rate was >70%: push one level up on the hierarchy
- If 50-70%: maintain current level
- If <50%: scale DOWN. The hierarchy is too steep. Find an easier step.
- If 0% for 2+ weeks: the current approach isn't working. Redesign the hierarchy or redirect to self-exploration.

### Confidence Check

"On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you'll complete these commitments?"

- 8-10: Good. Proceed.
- 6-7: Identify the blocker. Adjust if needed.
- Below 6: Immediately scale down commitments until confidence is 7+. Completing small commitments builds the muscle. Failing big commitments reinforces avoidance.

---

## Phase 4: Closing (2 min)

User generates a one-sentence takeaway. Not an insight — a commitment.

"In one sentence: what's the most important thing you'll do this week?"

Restate commitments. Close.

---

## Session Timing Discipline

If Phase 2 is running long (past 20 min mark), interrupt: "We've been exploring for 20 minutes. I want to make sure we leave time for concrete planning. Let's shift to actions."

The most common failure mode of coaching sessions: deep, fascinating conversation → no time for commitments → nothing changes. Guard Phase 3 aggressively.
