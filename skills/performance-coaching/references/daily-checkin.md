# Daily Check-In Protocol (5-10 min)

## Purpose

Quick accountability touch. Not exploration, not therapy, not strategy. Three questions, one commitment, done.

## The Three Questions

### 1. "What was your courage action today?"

Binary: did you do something uncomfortable that moves the business forward?

- If yes: "What was it? How did it feel? What actually happened vs. what you predicted?" Brief celebration. The prediction-vs-reality gap is the engine of change.
- If no: "What got in the way?" Do NOT let them explain for more than 2 sentences. Then: "What's the smallest version of that action you could do in the next 5 minutes?"
- If 3+ consecutive days with no courage action: "I want to name a pattern. Three days, no uncomfortable actions. The strategy hasn't changed. The avoidance is winning. What needs to shift?"

### 2. "Energy and willingness, 1-10?"

Quick pulse check. Track over time.

- 7-10: Good. Push appropriately. This is when to schedule harder exposure levels.
- 4-6: Normal operating range. Maintain current commitments. Don't scale up.
- 1-3: Something is off. Brief exploration: "What's draining you?" If persistent (3+ days below 4), suggest the self-exploration skill or a rest day. Burnout is real, not weakness.

### 3. "One specific commitment for tomorrow"

Must include three elements:

- **Time**: "At 9 AM" not "in the morning"
- **Action**: "I will send 3 cold emails to [specific list]" not "I'll do some outreach"
- **Metric**: "3 emails sent" not "work on outreach"

Format as implementation intention: "If it is [time] and I have [condition], then I will [specific action]."

If the commitment is vague, push: "Make it specific enough that a stranger could verify whether you did it."

If the commitment is too easy (zero discomfort), push: "What's one notch harder that would actually stretch you?"

If the commitment is too ambitious (pattern of committing big, completing nothing), scale down: "What's the smallest version you're 90% confident you'll actually do?"

## Missed Commitment Patterns

Track the **commitment-to-completion ratio** across days.

- **Above 70%**: Healthy. Gradually increase challenge.
- **50-70%**: Check if commitments are too large. Scale down until completion rate rises.
- **Below 50%**: The system is failing. Either commitments are wrong-sized, or avoidance is dominating. Name it directly: "You've completed [X] of [Y] commitments this week. Something isn't working. Let's figure out what."
- **Below 30% for 2+ weeks**: Coaching may be serving as avoidance. See anti-analysis.md. Consider whether the user needs the self-exploration skill first (unresolved pattern blocking action) or whether the commitments need fundamental restructuring.

## Closing

"Tomorrow: [restate commitment]. I'll ask you about it next time."

Keep it short. The daily check-in should take 5-10 minutes maximum. If it turns into a long conversation, the user is probably analyzing instead of doing. Redirect: "We're spending more time talking about the work than doing the work. Go do the thing."
